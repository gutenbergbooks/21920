<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>It is a pleasure to present to the public this digital edition, with
commentary, of <i>Ex Ponto</i> IV, the final poems written by the Roman poet
Ovid, published after his death as a posthumous collection quite
separate from the earlier <i>Ex Ponto</i> I-III.</p>

<p>These poems have a special place among Ovid's works, but have not
received the attention which they deserve. In particular, there has been
no full modern commentary on these poems.</p>

<p>This text presented in this edition is based on my personal examination
of ten manuscripts. I have also restored to the text certain readings
commonly accepted by editors until the nineteenth century. Finally, the
edition contains several dozen new textual conjectures by myself and
others.</p>


<h4>The intended audience of this edition</h4>

<p>This edition is intended to serve as a guide to the poems for
intermediate and advanced students of Latin poetry. However, I have
deliberately made it as straightforward as possible, and my hope is that
even a beginning student of Latin poetry embarking on the study of these
poems will find the commentary helpful.</p>

<p>This edition is also directed towards present and future Latin textual
critics.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span></p>

<p>My expectation when starting my research for this edition was that I
would be presenting a text that differed little from that to be found in
current editions. However, I made two discoveries during my research
into the text.</p>

<p>The first discovery was that many important textual corrections
generally accepted in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had been
suppressed by editors in the course of the nineteenth century. I have
restored many of these readings to the text, and others will be found in
the textual apparatus.</p>

<p>The second discovery was that there was a surprisingly large number of
passages which appeared to be corrupt and for which it was possible to
suggest corrections. Given the long history of Latin textual criticism,
and Ovid's central position in Roman literary history, it was surprising
to find that so much remained to be done. Yet such was the case.</p>

<p>Nothing is more certain than that this book of poems as well as the
three earlier books of the <i>Ex Ponto</i> represent an outstanding
opportunity for future editors and commentators to contribute to the
progress of Latin scholarship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span></p>


<h4>History of this edition</h4>

<p>I originally prepared this edition and commentary during my time as a
graduate student at the University of Toronto. Upon its completion (and
my graduation) in 1985, a copy was deposited at the National Library of
Canada.</p>

<p>Had I followed a university teaching career after graduation, I would
undoubtedly have taken the necessary steps to publish the edition, if
only in pursuit of academic promotion. But I instead chose a career in
the software industry, which both removed the external incentive to
publish the edition, and denied me the time that I would have needed to
prepare it for publication.</p>

<p>However, I wished to ensure that future editors and commentators were
aware of the edition and would be able to make use of it. I therefore
decided to publish two short articles drawn from the edition. These
articles were intended to make generally available two textual
conjectures which I considered likely to be correct. But the articles
were also intended to make future editors aware that I had worked on the
text of Ovid, so that they would seek out my unpublished edition.</p>

<p>The first article ("An Intrusive Gloss in Ovid <i>Ex Ponto</i> 4.13")
appeared in <i>Phoenix</i> (vol. 40, p. 322) in 1986: it reported the
restoration of IV xiii 45 discussed at <a href="#Page_408">page 408</a> of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span> commentary.
<i>Phoenix</i> is published by the Classical Association of Canada, and since
my own training in the classical languages had taken place almost
entirely in Canada, it seemed appropriate that my first publication
should be in a Canadian journal.</p>

<p>To my surprise and pleasure, my short article attracted a critique by
Professor Allan Kershaw ("<i>Ex Ponto</i> 4.13: A Reply", <i>Phoenix</i>, vol. 42,
p. 176), followed by a learned defense of my conjecture by Professor
James Butrica ("Taking Enemies for Chains: Ovid <i>Ex Ponto</i> 4.13.45
Again", <i>Phoenix</i>, vol. 43, pp. 258-59).</p>

<p>Four years later, I published a second article ("A Palaeographical
Corruption in Ovid, <i>Ex Ponto</i> 4.6"), which appeared in the May 1990
issue of the <i>Classical Quarterly</i> (<a href="#Page_283">pp. 283-84</a>). This article reported
the restoration of IV vi 38 discussed at <a href="#Page_240">pages 240-41</a> of the commentary.
I selected the <i>Classical Quarterly</i> because of its prominence within
the world of classical scholarship, and in particular because of its
close association with the modern history of Latin textual criticism: it
was in the <i>Classical Quarterly</i> that many of the learned articles of A.
E. Housman first appeared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p>My hope had been that these two articles would serve as a signpost that
would lead editors to my edition. The publication of J. A. Richmond's
Teubner edition of the <i>Ex Ponto</i> in 1990 proved that this plan was
inadequate. Professor Richmond had indeed discovered the existence of my
edition: it received a prominent and flattering mention at the end of
his preface. However, he stated that he received the microfilm of the
edition too late for use in his edition!</p>

<p>In his review of Richmond's Teubner edition in the <i>Classical Review</i>
(n.s. 42, 2 [1992], pp. 305-06), Professor James Butrica highlighted a
number of proposed emendations from my edition.</p>

<p>It had become clear there was considerable outside interest in the work
that I had done, and that simply having a copy of an unpublished edition
on deposit at the National Library of Canada was not a sufficient means
of making the edition available to the public, so over the years that
followed I gave some consideration to how I might publish the edition so
that it would be conveniently available to students of Latin poetry.</p>

<p>Early in 2006, I was working as a volunteer proofreader for the Project
Gutenberg digital library: I noticed that the Project Gutenberg library
included some public domain classical editions comparable in scope to my
own. Prompted by this, I decided that I would publish my edition online
in order to make it instantly accessible free of charge to anyone
wishing to use it. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> seemed in every way preferable to seeking out a
university press, going through the time-consuming process of seeking
the necessary grants to subsidize publication, in order to produce a
printed book so expensive that no student and not many libraries could
afford to purchase a copy.</p>


<h4>Nature of this edition</h4>

<p>In essence, this is a corrected version of the original typescript.
Typing errors have been corrected, and minor errors have been set right.</p>

<p>All statements made and conjectures proposed should be
considered to have been made in 1985.</p>


<h4>The HTML and Text versions of this edition</h4>

<p>This digital edition is being made available in two versions.</p>

<p>The <i>HTML version</i> takes advantage of the Unicode
character set to present Greek passages using the Greek
alphabet, and to present certain other special characters,
such as the macron. It also offers hyperlinks from the table
of contents and from the indices to the relevant sections of
the edition.</p>

<p>Popular and useful as HTML is, it does not offer the
universality of ASCII text. Essentially every computer
can display plain ASCII text correctly. The <i>Text version</i>
is presented so that the edition can be read on any computer,
large or small, new or old. However, this portability comes
at a price. The ISO 8859-1 ASCII character set does not include
the Greek alphabet, nor does it include certain special characters
which form part of this edition.</p>

<p>Therefore, the Text version of this edition presents Greek
passages transliterated into the Latin alphabet. Similarly,
in the textual apparatus any capital letter occurring in the
report of a manuscript should be considered to be that
letter in lower case, with a macron (dash) above.</p>

<p>When the textual apparatus reports a manuscript correction where
the original reading is no longer legible, the HTML version underlines
the corrected letters, but the Text version uses capitalization.
For example, the Text version reports "facTisque _B2c_" at iii 25:
a later hand in <i>B</i> has erased the original fourth letter, and has
replaced it with "t".</p>

<p>In the commentary, when metre is being discussed and
a Latin word is quoted, any vowel in that word which is
capitalized is long, and any vowel which is not capitalized
is short. I have occasionally pointed out explicitly that
a word is metrically inconvenient because it has a series
of short vowels: in the HTML edition, because the actual
letters are marked short, these statements will appear to
be redundant.</p>

<p>In the Latin text, the start and end of passages which are deeply
corrupt and therefore difficult to correct are indicated by an
asterisk, instead of the usual dagger (obelus).</p>

<p>Finally, in the critical apparatus, 'æ' is used where a
manuscript has 'e' with a cedilla.</p>


<h4>Enhancements made: the indices</h4>

<p>In order to make the digital edition as useful as possible, I have added
this preface, a full table of contents, and two indices.</p>

<p>The first index (starting on <a href="#Page_477">page 477</a>) is an index of <i>topics
discussed</i>. It is a selective rather than an exhaustive index for the
following two reasons:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>

<p>(1) A commentary is already in effect indexed by the text it is linked
to. If, for instance, readers wish to find what the commentary has to
say about a certain passage, all they need do is turn to the part of the
commentary dealing with that passage.</p>

<p>(2) A digital edition can be searched online very quickly and easily. A
reader wishing to find any mention of the eminent Dutch textual critic
Nicolaus Heinsius could find every mention of Heinsius in the edition
simply by using "Heinsius" as a search argument.</p>

<p>However, some of the discussions in the commentary do not have an
obvious link to the text, nor would they necessarily be found quickly by
an electronic search. An example would be the discussion of "Simple
verbs used for compound ones" at <a href="#Page_281">page 281</a>.</p>

<p>Also, there were some parts of the introduction and commentary which I
wanted to highlight to the reader as being of possible interest:
including references to these in the index would serve this purpose.</p>

<p>For similar reasons, I have included (starting on <a href="#Page_489">page 489</a>) an index of
textual emendations first proposed in this edition. Some of these
emendations involve works other than <i>Ex Ponto</i> IV, and authors other
than Ovid. The index of textual emendations makes these corrections easy
to find.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>


<h4>The debt I owe to others</h4>

<p>I was able to create this edition only because of the help that I have
received over the years from others.</p>

<p>My basic training in the classical languages took place at the
University of British Columbia, where I completed my B.A. in 1974, and
my M.A. in 1977. It is impossible to repay the debt I owe to every
single member of the Classics Department at that time.</p>

<p>Professor Charles Murgia of the University of California (Berkeley)
initiated me into the mysteries of Latin palaeography and textual
criticism.</p>

<p>I created this edition while a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of
Classics at the University of Toronto. I owe an enormous debt of
gratitude to Professor Richard Tarrant, who encouraged me to undertake
the edition, posed many excellent questions, and offered many excellent
suggestions.</p>

<p>I owe a similar debt to Professor Alexander Dalzell, Professor Elaine
Fantham, Professor J. N. Grant, and Professor C. P. Jones, all of them
members of the Graduate Department of Classics at the University of
Toronto when I was creating the edition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span></p>


<p>I have known Rob Morrow for twenty-one years, and he has touched every
aspect of my life. The study of Latin poetry is a field of endeavour far
removed from his usual interests: but even here he has made an important
contribution in the work he did in scanning the original typescript, and
in his continuing encouragement and support during the months I worked
on creating this digital edition. It is to him, with deep affection and
gratitude, that I dedicate this edition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>In AD 8, when he was fifty years of age, Ovid was abruptly banished from
Rome to Tomis, an exile from which he never returned. In his poetry from
exile, he gives two reasons for the banishment: the publication of the
<i>Ars Amatoria</i>, and an unnamed error (<i>Tr</i> II 207; <i>EP</i> III iii
71-72)<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. The <i>Ars Amatoria</i> had been published some years previously,
being generally dated on the basis of <i>AA</i> I 171-72 to 2 BC or shortly
thereafter; compare <i>Tr</i> II 545-46. The error was clearly the real cause
of the banishment; what precisely this <i>error</i> was Ovid does not reveal,
but it appears from <i>Tr</i> II 103-4 and <i>Tr</i> III v 49-50 to have been the
witnessing of some action that was embarrassing to the imperial family.
Beyond this nothing is known, for Ovid was careful to avoid compounding
his original mistake by mentioning what it consisted of.</p>

<p>The catastrophe which befell Ovid did not put an end to his poetic
activity; from the eight or nine years of his exile we possess a corpus
of elegiac verse that substantially exceeds in bulk the combined
production of Tibullus and Propertius.</p>

<p>The first work produced by Ovid was book I of the <i>Tristia</i>. Although it
is perhaps not literally true that Ovid wrote much of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> poetry on
shipboard (<i>Tr</i> I xi 3-10), all of the poems are directly related to the
circumstances of his downfall and his journey to exile; and it is
reasonable to suppose that the book was published shortly after Ovid's
arrival in Tomis.</p>

<p>In his first poems from exile, Ovid had attempted to engage the sympathy
of the public on his behalf; his next production was a direct appeal to
Augustus in the 578-line elegiac poem that comprises the second book of
the <i>Tristia</i>. The poem is written with Ovid's usual clarity and
elegance, but its failure to secure his recall is not surprising. The
poem deals only with the publication of the <i>Ars Amatoria</i>, which was
not the true cause of the exile; and rather than admitting his guilt and
appealing to Augustus' clemency, Ovid tactlessly argues that Augustus
had been wrong to exile him.</p>

<p>The years 10, 11, and 12 saw the publication of the final three books of
the <i>Tristia</i>. The charge of monotony that is generally brought against
Ovid's poetry from exile (and was brought by his friends at the time;
Ovid makes his defence in <i>EP</i> III ix) is most nearly true of these
three books of verse. He was unable to name his correspondents and vary
his poetry with personal references as he was to do in the <i>Ex Ponto</i>;
and the pain of exile was so fresh as to exclude other topics.</p>

<p>Not all of Ovid's literary efforts in exile were devoted to his letters.
It appears from <i>Fast</i> IV 81-82 and VI 666, as well as from the
dedication to Germanicus at the start of the first book (at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> <i>Tr</i> II 551
Ovid says he dedicated the work to Augustus) that the <i>Fasti</i> in the
edition we possess is a revision produced by Ovid in exile after the
death of Augustus.</p>

<p>In AD 12 Ovid produced the <i>Ibis</i>. The greater part of the poem is a
series of curses showing such minute mythological learning that many of
them have not been explained; but the poem's lengthy exordium is a
powerful treatment of Ovid's circumstances and Ibis's perfidy that has
been considered Ovid's most perfect literary creation (Housman 1041).</p>

<p>Many scholars also ascribe the composition of the final six <i>Heroides</i>
to the period of Ovid's exile; but although the literary appeal of these
three sets of double epistles is considerable, I believe that their
comparative diffuseness of manner indicates that Ovid was not their
author. They are, however, clearly modelled on the <i>Heroides</i> written by
Ovid, and I have frequently quoted from them in the commentary.</p>

<p>In AD 12 Ovid must have received some indication that it was safe for
him to name his correspondents. He took full advantage of this new
opportunity to induce his friends to work on his behalf; it is clear
from Ovid's references to his fourth year of exile (I ii 26, I viii 28)
and to Tiberius' triumph of 23 October AD 12 (II i 1 &amp; 46, II ii 75-76,
II v 27-28, III i 136, III iii 86, III iv 3)<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> that all three books
were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> written within the space of a single year: as fast a rate of
composition as can be proved for any part of Ovid's life. The three
books were published as a unit: the opening poem of the first book and
the closing poem of the last are addressed to Brutus, who was therefore
the dedicatee of the collection; both poems are apologies for Ovid's
verse. No such framing poems are found at the start of books II or III,
or at the end of books I and II, although the addressees of II i and III
i, Germanicus and Ovid's wife, were clearly chosen for their respective
importance and closeness to Ovid.</p>


<h4><i>Ex Ponto</i> IV</h4>

<p>The fourth book of the <i>Ex Ponto</i> constitutes a work separate from the
three books composed in AD 12. The earliest datable poem in the book is
the fourth, written shortly before Sextus Pompeius' consulship in AD 14;
the latest is the ninth, written in honour of Graecinus' becoming
suffect consul in AD 16. Of the books of Ovid's verse which are
collections of individual poems, the fourth book of the <i>Ex Ponto</i> is
the longest, being some 926 lines in length (excluding the probably
spurious distichs xv 25-26 and xvi 51-52). The mean average length of
such books is 764 lines; and the next longest after <i>Ex Ponto</i> IV is
<i>Am</i> III, with 824 lines (excluding the spurious fifth poem). I take the
length of the book as an indication that in its present form it is
probably a posthumous collection: Ovid's editor either gathered the
individual poems to form a single book that was unusually long,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> or
added a few later poems to a book previously assembled by Ovid<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>Syme (<i>HO</i> 156) argues that the order of the poems indicates that Ovid
survived to publish or at least to arrange the book: the fact that the
first and penultimate poems are addressed to Sextus Pompeius indicates
that Ovid dedicated the book to him. Professor R. J. Tarrant points out
to me correspondences of structure between <i>EP</i> IV and some of Ovid's
earlier books. If the sixteenth and final poem of <i>EP</i> IV is considered
a <i>sphragis</i>-poem, as is indicated by <i>Nasonis</i> in the opening line, we
are left with a fifteen-poem book of which the first and last poems are
addressed to Sextus Pompeius, and in which the middle poem is addressed
to Germanicus through his client Suillius<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. The same structural
outline of 1-8-15 appears in <i>Amores</i> I and III&mdash;the opening and closing
poems of both books are concerned with Ovid's verse, while the eighth
poem of each book stands somewhat apart from the other poems: <i>Am</i> I
viii is about the procuress Dipsas, while III ix (the eighth poem in the
book after the removal of the spurious fifth poem) is the elegy on the
death of Tibullus.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<h4>Ovid's addressees in <i>Ex Ponto</i> IV</h4>

<p>Sextus Pompeius, <i>consul ordinarius</i> in 14, and himself a relative of
Augustus, is the recipient of no less than four letters in <i>EP</i> IV<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.
It is significant that he is not the recipient of any of Ovid's earlier
letters from exile; this is discussed in the next section.</p>

<p>In the attention Ovid gives Sextus Pompeius there can be seen, according
to Syme (<i>HO</i> 156), a deliberate attempt to gain the favour of
Germanicus, who is mentioned in connection with Sextus Pompeius at v 25.
It is interesting that in viii Ovid addresses Germanicus' quaestor
Suillius (and in the course of the poem addresses Germanicus), and that
the recipient of xiii is Carus, the tutor of Germanicus' sons. But it is
only natural that Ovid, when at last permitted, should address so
influential a man as his benefactor Sextus Pompeius; and it does not
seem strange that he should address his fellow poet Carus, still less
that he should send a letter to Suillius, husband of his stepdaughter
Perilla.</p>

<p>C. Pomponius Graecinus, the recipient of ix, must have had some
political influence, since the poem is in celebration of his becoming
suffect consul in 16. But he probably owed this influence to his brother
Flaccus, a close friend of Tiberius who succeeded Graecinus as <i>consul
ordinarius</i> for 17, and whom Ovid gives prominent mention at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> ix 57 ff.
Graecinus must have been an old associate of Ovid, since he has the rare
distinction of being mentioned by name in a poem written by Ovid before
his exile (<i>Am</i> II x 1).</p>

<p>Two of Ovid's correspondents were orators. Gallio, the addressee of the
eleventh poem, is frequently quoted by the elder Seneca. He was a
senator; both Tacitus and Dio give accounts of how he fell into
disfavour with Tiberius for proposing that ex-members of the Praetorian
guard be granted the privilege of using the theatre seats reserved for
members of the equestrian order (<i>Ann</i> VI 3; LVIII 18 4). Brutus, the
recipient of the sixth poem and dedicatee of the first three books of
the <i>Ex Ponto</i>, is not mentioned by other writers, but it appears from
vi 29-38 that he had a considerable reputation as a forensic orator,
although some allowance must be made for possible exaggeration in Ovid's
description of his close friend. The poem contains six lines on the
death of Fabius Maximus, to whom Ovid had addressed <i>EP</i> I ii and III
iii; perhaps he and Brutus had been associates.</p>

<p>Five epistles are addressed to Ovid's fellow poets. Cornelius Severus,
the recipient of the second poem, was one of the most famous epic poets
of the day; he is mentioned by Quintilian (X i 89), and the elder Seneca
preserves his lines on the death of Cicero (<i>Suas</i> VI 26), Albinovanus
Pedo, the recipient of the tenth epistle, was known as a writer of
hexameter verse and of epigram. He served in Germanicus' campaign of AD
15 (Tac <i>Ann</i> I 60 2), and the elder Seneca preserves a fragment of his
poem on Germanicus' campaigns (<i>Suas</i> I 15). It might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> be argued that in
addressing him Ovid is once again trying to win Germanicus' favour. But
in view of his intimacy with Ovid (mentioned at Sen <i>Cont</i> II 2 12),
Albinovanus seems a natural choice to receive one of Ovid's letters.
Tuticanus, the recipient of the twelfth and fourteenth poems and author
of a <i>Phaeacid</i> based on Homer (mentioned at xii 27 and again in the
catalogue of poets at xvi 29), is known only through the <i>Ex Ponto</i>; the
same is true of Carus, author of a poem on Hercules and, as already
mentioned, tutor of the sons of Germanicus.</p>

<p>Vestalis, the recipient of the seventh poem, is in a class separate from
the other recipients of Ovid's verse epistles. As <i>primipilaris</i> of the
legion stationed in the vicinity, he would of course have been without
influence at Rome, but as (apparently) the prefect of the region around
Tomis, he presumably had some control over Ovid's circumstances.</p>

<p>The traitorous friend to whom the third poem is addressed was a real
person, for Ovid is quite explicit when speaking of their past together
and of the friend's perfidy towards him; the same cannot be said of the
<i>inuidus</i> to whom is addressed the concluding poem of the book, a
defence of Ovid's reputation as a poet.</p>

<p>Cotta Maximus, the younger son of Tibullus' patron Messalla, is
prominently mentioned at xvi 41-44 as an unpublished poet of outstanding
excellence. He is the recipient of six letters in the earlier books of
the <i>Ex Ponto</i>. Syme finds it significant that there is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> no poem in <i>EP</i>
IV addressed to Cotta: 'Ovid ... was now concentrating his efforts
elsewhere: Germanicus, the friends of Germanicus, Sextus Pompeius ... The
tardy tribute may perhaps be interpreted as a veiled reproach' (<i>HO</i>
128). But arguments from silence are dangerous; and Ovid's mention of
Cotta seems flattering enough.</p>

<p>It is perhaps safer to postulate a change in Ovid's feelings towards his
wife. She is never mentioned in <i>EP</i> IV, although she had been the
recipient of some eight earlier letters from exile (<i>Tr</i> I vi, III iii,
IV iii, V ii, xi, xiv, <i>EP</i> I iv, III i; <i>Tr</i> V v was written in honour
of her birthday). At <i>EP</i> III vii 11-12 Ovid indicates that his wife's
efforts on his behalf had not matched his hopes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">nec grauis uxori dicar, quae scilicet in me<br /></span>
<span class="i1">quam proba tam timida est experiensque parum.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The fact that Ovid chose not to address any verse epistle to his wife
during his final years at Tomis may well reflect a cooling in his
attitude towards her.</p>


<h4>Differences between <i>Ex Ponto</i> IV and the earlier poetry from exile</h4>

<p>The criticism most often made of Ovid's poems from exile is that they
are repetitive and therefore monotonous. <i>EP</i> III ix 1-4 shows that the
same criticism was made while Ovid was still alive:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quod sit in his eadem sententia, Brute, libellis,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">carmina nescio quem carpere nostra refers:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">nil nisi me terra fruar ut propiore rogare,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">et quam sim denso cinctus ab hoste loqui.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Ovid does not attempt to deny the criticism, but explains that he wished
to obtain the assistance of as many people as possible:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">et tamen haec eadem cum sint, non scripsimus isdem,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">unaque per plures uox mea temptat opem.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="center"><i>(41-42)</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">nec liber ut fieret, sed uti sua cuique daretur<br /></span>
<span class="i1">littera, propositum curaque nostra fuit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">postmodo collectas utcumque sine ordine iunxi:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">hoc opus electum ne mihi forte putes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">da ueniam scriptis, quorum non gloria nobis<br /></span>
<span class="i1">causa, sed utilitas officiumque fuit.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="center"><i>(51-56)</i></p>

<p>Ovid's explanation is reasonable enough, and is confirmed by the speed
with which he composed the first three books of the <i>Ex Ponto</i> once he
knew that it was safe to name people in his verse. The first three books
of the <i>Ex Ponto</i>, like the <i>Tristia</i>, were written with the single
objective of securing Ovid's recall, and this naturally caused a certain
repetition of subject-matter.</p>

<p>By the time Ovid wrote the poems that would form the fourth book of the
<i>Ex Ponto</i>, he had lived in Tomis for six or more years, and it must
have been clear to him that his chances of recall were slight. The
result of this is a diminished use of his personal situation as a theme
for his verse. Often he introduces his plight in only one or two
distichs of a poem, subordinating the topic to the poem's main theme.
The result of this technique can be seen in such extended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> passages as
the descriptions of the investiture of the new consul (iv &amp; ix), the
address to Germanicus on the power of poetry (viii), or the catalogue of
poets that concludes the book. In all of these passages Ovid's desire
for recall is only a secondary theme.</p>


<h4>The mixing of levels of diction</h4>

<p>As well as variety of subject, the fourth book of the <i>Ex Ponto</i> shows a
variation in style that is typical of Ovid's letters from exile. The
poems use the metre and language of elegiac verse. But at the same time
they are <i>letters</i>, and are strongly influenced by the structure and
vocabulary of prose epistles. This influence is naturally more obvious
at some points than at others; and even within a single poem there can
be a surprising degree of variation in the different sections of the
poem.</p>

<p>Some poems tend more to one extreme than the other. The eleventh poem, a
letter of commiseration to Gallio on the death of his wife, is
extensively indebted to the genre of the prose letter of consolation;
this prose influence is evident in such passages as:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">finitumque tuum, si non ratione, dolorem<br /></span>
<span class="i1">ipsa iam pridem suspicor esse mora<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="center"><i>(13-14)</i></p>

<p>At the opposite extreme is the final poem of the book, a defence of
Ovid's poetry; as this was a traditional poetic subject, the level of
diction throughout the poem is extremely high, particularly in the
catalogue of poets that forms the main body of the poem.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>An interesting result of the mixture of styles is the presence in the
poems of exile of words and expressions which belong essentially to
prose, being otherwise rarely or never found in verse. Some instances
from <i>Ex Ponto</i> IV are <i>ad summam</i> (i 15), <i>conuictor</i> (iii 15),
<i>abunde</i> (viii 37), <i>ex toto</i> (viii 72), <i>di faciant</i> (ix 3), <i>secreto</i>
(ix 31), <i>respectu</i> (ix 100), <i>quominus</i> (xii 1), <i>praefrigidus</i> (xii
35), and <i>tantummodo</i> (xvi 49).</p>

<p>Both in subject and style the sixteen poems of <i>Ex Ponto</i> IV show a wide
variety, worthy of the creator of the <i>Metamorphoses</i>. The following
section examines the special characteristics of each of the poems.</p>


<h4>The letters to Sextus Pompeius</h4>

<p>Sextus Pompeius is the recipient of poems i, iv, v, and xv; only Cotta
Maximus and Ovid's wife have more letters from exile addressed to them.
It is clear from the opening of IV i that Pompeius had himself
prohibited Ovid from addressing him; and Ovid is careful to present
himself as a client rather than a friend; the tone is of almost abject
humility, and he shows circumspection in his requests for assistance.</p>

<p>In the opening of the first poem, Ovid describes how difficult it had
been to prevent himself from naming Pompeius in his verse; in the
climactic ten lines he declares that he is entirely Pompeius' creation.
Only in the transition between the topics does he refer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> to future help
from Pompeius, linking it with the assistance he is already providing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">nunc quoque nil subitis clementia territa fatis<br /></span>
<span class="i1">auxilium uitae fertque feretque meae.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="center"><i>(25-26)</i></p>

<p>The fourth poem is a description of how Fama came to Ovid and told him
of Pompeius' election to the consulship; Ovid then pictures the joyous
scene of the accession. At the end of the poem he indirectly asks for
Pompeius' assistance, praying that at some point he may remember him in
exile. The device of having Fama report Pompeius' accession to the
consulship serves to emphasize the importance of the event and raise the
tone of the poem. Ovid had earlier used Fama as the formal addressee of
<i>EP</i> II i, which described his reaction to the news of Germanicus'
triumph. In the fifth poem Ovid achieves a similar effect through the
device of addressing the poem itself, giving it directions on where it
will find Pompeius and what consular duties he might be performing<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.
Only in the concluding distich does Ovid direct the poem to ask for his
assistance.</p>

<p>The fifteenth poem contains Ovid's most forceful appeal for Pompeius'
assistance. It is interesting to observe the techniques<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> Ovid uses to
avoid offending Pompeius. The first part of the poem is a metaphorical
description of how Ovid is as much Pompeius' property as his many
estates or his house in Rome. This leads to Ovid's request:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">atque utinam possis, et detur amicius aruum,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">remque tuam ponas in meliore loco!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">quod quoniam in dis est, tempta lenire precando<br /></span>
<span class="i1">numina perpetua quae pietate colis.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="center"><i>(21-24)</i></p>

<p>He then attempts to compensate for the boldness of his request. First he
says that his appeal is unnecessary:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">nec dubitans oro; sed flumine saepe secundo<br /></span>
<span class="i1">augetur remis cursus euntis aquae.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="center"><i>(27-38)</i></p>

<p>Then he apologizes for making such constant requests:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">et pudet et metuo semperque eademque precari<br /></span>
<span class="i1">ne subeant animo taedia iusta tuo<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="center"><i>(29-30)</i></p>

<p>He ends the poem with a return to the topic of the benefits Pompeius has
already rendered him.</p>


<h4>The letter to Suillius addressing Germanicus</h4>

<p>No poem in the fourth book of the <i>Ex Ponto</i> is addressed to a member of
the imperial family, but the greater part of IV viii, nominally
addressed to Suillius, is in fact directed to his patron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> Germanicus.
Suillius' family ties with Ovid and his influential position would have
made it natural for Ovid to address him in the earlier books of the <i>Ex
Ponto</i> or even in the <i>Tristia</i>; and it is clear from the opening of the
poem that Suillius must have distanced himself from Ovid:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Littera sera quidem, studiis exculte Suilli,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">huc tua peruenit, sed mihi grata tamen<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the section that follows, Ovid asks for Suillius' assistance, rather
strangely setting forth his own impeccable family background and moral
purity; then he moves to the topic of Suillius' piety towards
Germanicus, and in line 31 begins to address Germanicus with a direct
request for his assistance. In the fifty-eight lines that follow he
develops the argument that Germanicus should accept the verse Ovid
offers him for two reasons: poetry grants immortality to the subjects it
describes; and Germanicus is himself a poet. In this passage Ovid allows
himself a very high level of diction; as the topic was congenial to him,
the result is perhaps the finest extended passage of verse in the
book<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>Ovid ends his address to Germanicus by asking for his assistance; only
in the final distich of the poem does he return to Suillius.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>


<h4>The letters to Brutus and Graecinus</h4>

<p>Only two of the ten addressees named by Ovid in <i>EP</i> IV were recipients
of earlier letters from him. Brutus, to whom IV vi is addressed, was
also the addressee of <i>EP</i> I i and III ix, while Graecinus, to whom IV
ix is addressed, was the recipient of <i>EP</i> I vi and II vi.</p>

<p>There is some difference between Ovid's treatment of Brutus and
Graecinus in <i>EP</i> IV and in the earlier poems. <i>EP</i> IV vi is highly
personal, being mostly devoted to a lengthy description of Brutus'
apparently conflicting but in fact complementary qualities of tenacity
as a prosecuting advocate and of kindness towards those in need; no poem
in the fourth book of the <i>Ex Ponto</i> is more completely concerned with
the addressee as a person. In contrast, nothing is said of Brutus in
<i>EP</i> I i, where he acts as the mere recipient of the plea that he
protect Ovid's poems, or in III ix, where Brutus is the reporter of
another's remarks on the monotony of Ovid's subject-matter. The address
to Graecinus in IV ix, on the other hand, is much less personal than in
I vi and II vi. The part of <i>EP</i> IV ix concerned with Graecinus
describes his elevation to the consulship, and was clearly written (in
some haste) to celebrate the event. The earlier poems are more concerned
with Graecinus as an individual: in <i>EP</i> I vi Ovid describes at length
Graecinus' kindliness of spirit and his closeness to his exiled friend,
while in II vi Ovid admits the justice of the criticism Graecinus makes
of the conduct which led to his exile, but thanks him for his support
and asks for its continuance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>


<h4>The letters to Tuticanus</h4>

<p>The two letters to Tuticanus show a similar dichotomy.</p>

<p>Of the two poems, xii is more personal and more concerned with poetry.
The first eighteen lines are a witty demonstration of the impossibility
of using Tuticanus' name in elegiac verse, while the twelve verses that
follow recall their poetic apprenticeship together. In the final twelve
lines, referring to Tuticanus' senatorial career, Ovid asks him to help
his cause in any way possible.</p>

<p>Poem xiv is far less personal than the earlier epistle. The only mention
of Tuticanus is at the poem's beginning:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Haec tibi mittuntur quem sum modo carmine questus<br /></span>
<span class="i1">non aptum numeris nomen habere meis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">in quibus, excepto quod adhuc utcumque ualemus,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">nil te praeterea quod iuuet inuenies.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The bulk of the poem is a defense against charges raised by some of the
Tomitans that he has defamed them in his verse. Ovid answers that he was
complaining about the physical conditions at Tomis, not the people, to
whom he owes a great debt. It is characteristic of the fourth book of
the <i>Ex Ponto</i> that Ovid complains less of his exile than in his earlier
verse from exile; this poem furnishes the most explicit demonstration
that the years spent in exile and the dwindling likelihood of recall has
made Ovid reach an accommodation with his new conditions of life.</p>

<p>The topic of the poem clearly has no relation to Tuticanus; Professor R.
J. Tarrant points out to me Ovid's use of the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> technique in some of
the <i>Amores</i>, such as I ix (<i>Militat omnis amans</i>), and II x, to
Graecinus on loving two women at once, where there is no apparent
connection between the addressee and the subject of the poem. Professor
E. Fantham notes that the bulk of xiv could even have been written
before Ovid chose Tuticanus as its addressee.</p>


<h4>Other letters to poets</h4>

<p>Three other poems in the book are addressed to poets. In all of them
poetry itself is a primary subject.</p>


<h4>The letter to Severus</h4>

<p>The second poem in the book, addressed to the epic poet Severus, opens
with a contrast of the situations of the two poets. The main body of the
poem is concerned with the difficulty of composing under the conditions
Ovid endures at Tomis, and the comfort that he even so derives from
pursuing his old calling. The poem is well constructed and the language
vivid. A particularly fine example of the use Ovid makes of differing
levels of diction is found at 35-38:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">excitat auditor studium, laudataque uirtus<br /></span>
<span class="i1">crescit, et immensum gloria calcar habet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">hic mea cui recitem nisi flauis scripta Corallis,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">quasque alias gentes barbarus Hister obit?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The emotional height of the tricolon, where Ovid describes poetic
inspiration, gives way to a comparatively prosaic distich where he
explains that the conditions necessary for inspiration do not exist at
Tomis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>At the poem's conclusion Ovid reverts to Severus, asking that he send
Ovid some recent piece of work.</p>


<h4>The letter to Albinovanus Pedo</h4>

<p>In the tenth poem of the book, poetry is not the main subject; instead,
Ovid describes the hardships he endures at Tomis, and then describes at
length the reasons the Black Sea freezes over. Towards the end of the
letter, however, he explains why he is writing a poem to Albinovanus on
this seemingly irrelevant topic<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. The language recalls the poem to
Severus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'detinui' dicam 'tempus, curasque fefelli;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">hunc fructum praesens attulit hora mihi.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">abfuimus solito dum scribimus ista dolore,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">in mediis nec nos sensimus esse Getis.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="center"><i>(67-70)</i></p>

<p>In the poem's concluding lines he links his own situation with the
<i>Theseid</i> Albinovanus is engaged on: just as Theseus was faithful, so
Albinovanus should be faithful to Ovid.</p>


<h4>The letter to Gallio</h4>

<p>This letter is remarkable for its economy of structure, and indeed is so
short as to seem rather perfunctory. Only twenty-two lines in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> length,
it is a letter of consolation addressed to Gallio on the death of his
wife. In the first four lines Ovid apologizes for not having written to
him earlier. Ovid's exile serves as a bridge to the main topic of the
poem:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">atque utinam rapti iactura laesus amici<br /></span>
<span class="i1">sensisses ultra quod quererere nihil<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="center"><i>(5-6)</i></p>

<p>The remainder of the poem consists of the ingenious interweaving of
various commonplaces of consolation. The poem is a good illustration of
the secondary importance Ovid often gives his own misfortune in the
fourth book of the <i>Ex Ponto</i>.</p>


<h4>The letter to Carus</h4>

<p>The thirteenth poem, like the second letter to Tuticanus, shows Ovid's
acceptance of his life in Tomis. In it he tells Carus of the favourable
reception given a poem he had written in Getic on the apotheosis of
Augustus. The poem's opening is of interest as showing Ovid's
consciousness of verbal wit as a special characteristic of his verse. He
starts the poem with a play on the meaning of Carus' name, then tells
him that the opening will by itself tell him who his correspondent is.
In the lines that follow he discusses the individuality of his own style
and that of Carus; this serves to introduce the subject of his Getic
verse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>


<h4>The letter to Vestalis</h4>

<p>The subordination of the topic of Ovid's exile to another subject can be
clearly seen in the seventh poem of the book, addressed to Vestalis,
<i>primipilaris</i> of a legion stationed in the area of Tomis. As in the
letter to Gallio, mention of Ovid's personal misfortune is confined to
one short passage near the start of the poem:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">aspicis en praesens quali iaceamus in aruo,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">nec me testis eris falsa solere queri<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="center"><i>(3-4)</i></p>

<p>The descriptions that follow of wine freezing solid in the cold and of
the Sarmatian herdsman driving his wagon across the frozen Danube are so
picturesque that the reader's attention is drawn away from Ovid's
personal situation. Ovid describes the poisoned arrows used in the
region; then, in language recalling his letter to Gallio, expresses his
regret that Vestalis has had personal experience of these weapons:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">atque utinam pars haec tantum spectata fuisset,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">non etiam proprio cognita Marte tibi!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="center"><i>(13-14)</i></p>

<p>The remainder of the poem is a description of Vestalis' capture of
Aegissos. The description is conventional and unfelt; Ovid seems merely
to have assembled a few standard topics of military panegyric.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>


<h4>The third poem</h4>

<p>Poem iii, addressed to an unidentified friend who had proved faithless,
is a well-crafted but not particularly original warning that Fortune is
a changeable goddess, and his friend might well find find himself one
day in Ovid's position. The familiar examples of Croesus, Pompey, and
Marius are used; as the last and therefore most important example Ovid
uses his own catastrophe. The device recalls the <i>Ibis</i>, where Ovid's
final curse is to wish his enemy's exile to Tomis.</p>


<h4>Poem xvi</h4>

<p>The concluding poem of the book is a defence of Ovid's poetry. The
poem's argument is that poets generally become famous only after their
death, but that Ovid gained his reputation while still alive. The
greater part of the poem is a catalogue of Ovid's contemporary poets,
the argument being that even in such company he was illustrious.</p>

<p>As elsewhere he equates his exile with death; the defence of his poetry
therefore includes only the poetry that he wrote before his exile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="TEXTUAL_INTRODUCTION" id="TEXTUAL_INTRODUCTION"></a>TEXTUAL INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h4>The Manuscripts</h4>


<p>The manuscript authority for the text of the fourth book of the <i>Ex
Ponto</i> is significantly poorer than for the earlier books because of the
absence of <i>A</i>, <i>Hamburgensis scrin. 52 F</i>. This ninth-century
manuscript has been recognized since the time of Heinsius as the most
important witness for the text of the <i>Ex Ponto</i>; it breaks off,
however, at III ii 67.</p>

<p>The manuscript authorities for the fourth book can be placed in three
categories. The fragmentary <i>G</i> is from a different tradition than the
other manuscripts. <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> are closely related, and offer the best
witness to the main tradition. The other manuscripts I have collated are
more greatly affected by contamination and interpolation; of them <i>M</i>
and <i>F</i> show some independence, while no subclassification can be made
of <i>H</i>, <i>I</i>, <i>L</i>, or <i>T</i>.</p>


<h4><i>G</i></h4>

<p>The <i>fragmentum Guelferbytanum</i>, <i>Cod. Guelf. 13.11 Aug. 4&deg;</i>, generally
dated to the fifth or sixth century, is the oldest manuscript witness to
any of Ovid's poems. Part of the collection of the Herzog August
Bibliothek in Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, it was discovered by Carl Schoenemann, who
published his discovery in 1829; details of his monograph will be found
in the bibliography. The two pieces of parchment are a palimpsest,
having been reused in the eighth century<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> for a text of Augustine; later
they were incorporated into a bookbinding. As a result of this treatment
they are in extremely poor condition.</p>

<p><i>G</i> contains all or part of ix 101-8, ix 127-33, xii 15-19, and xii
41-44. To make it perfectly clear when <i>G</i> is a witness to the text, I
have not grouped it with other manuscripts, but have always specified it
by name. If <i>G</i> is not mentioned in an apparatus entry, it is not extant
for the text concerned.</p>

<p><i>G</i> is written in uncial script, with no division between words but with
indentation of the pentameters. Its one contribution to the
establishment of the text is at ix 103, where it reads <i>quamquam ... sit</i>
instead of the more usual <i>quamquam ... est</i> found in the other
manuscripts. In general, the text offered by <i>G</i> is surprisingly poor.
At ix 108 it reads <i>fato</i> for <i>facto</i>, at ix 130 it has the false and
unmetrical spelling <i>praeces</i>, at ix 132 it has <i>misscelite</i> for <i>misi
caelite</i>, at xii 17 it reads <i>lati</i> for <i>dilati</i>, and at xii 19 <i>naia</i>
for <i>nota</i>. These errors demonstrate that the rest of the tradition does
not descend from <i>G</i>.</p>

<p>Korn gives an accurate transcription of the fragment in the introduction
to his edition; photographs of parts of the fragment can be found at
Chatelain, <i>Pal&eacute;ographie des classiques latins</i>, tab. xcix, 2 and E. A.
Lowe, <i>Codices Latini Antiquiores</i>, vol. IX, p. 40, no. 1377.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>


<h4><i>B</i> and <i>C</i></h4>

<p><i>Monacensis latinus 384</i> and <i>Mon. lat. 19476</i>, both dated by editors to
the twelfth century, are descended from a common ancestor. This is
easily demonstrated by the large number of shared errors not found in
other manuscripts<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. At iv 36 <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> have <i>intendunt</i> for the
correct <i>intendent</i>, at viii 6 <i>uolo</i> for <i>uoco</i>, at viii 18
<i>perueniemus</i> for <i>inueniemur</i> (<i>-ntur</i>,<i>-mus</i>), at viii 44 <i>illa</i> for
<i>ulla</i>, at viii 89 <i>cara</i> for <i>care</i>, at ix 44 <i>fingit</i> for <i>finget</i>, at
ix 71 <i>quod</i> for <i>cum</i> (<i>FILT</i>) and <i>ut</i> (<i>HM</i>), at ix 92 <i>praestat</i> for
<i>perstat</i>, at ix 97 <i>et</i> for <i>ut</i>, at xiii 5 <i>certe est</i> for <i>certe</i>,
and at xiv 30 <i>culpatus</i> for <i>culpatis</i>. In some of these passages <i>B</i>'s
still visible original reading has been corrected by a later hand. In
other passages it is clear from the signs of correction that <i>B</i>
originally agreed with <i>C</i> in distinctive readings now preserved in C
alone: <i>subito</i> for <i>sed et</i> (iii 27), <i>erat</i> for <i>eras</i> (vi 9),
<i>occidit</i> for <i>occidis</i> (vi 11), <i>suspicit</i> for <i>suscipit</i> (ix 90),
<i>parent</i> for <i>darent</i> (xvi 31).</p>

<p><i>B</i> and <i>C</i> on the whole offer a better text than any other manuscript.
At iii 44 <i>B<sup>1</sup></i> and <i>C</i> omit the lost pentameter, where the other
manuscripts offer interpolations. At iv 11 they alone give the probably
correct <i>solus</i> for <i>tristis</i>, at xii 3 <i>aut</i> for <i>ast</i>, and at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> xvi 31
<i>tyrannis</i> (conjectured by Heinsius) for <i>tyranni</i>. At v 40 <i>C</i> and <i>B<sup>2</sup></i>
alone have the correct <i>mancipii ... tui</i> for <i>mancipium ... tuum</i>.</p>

<p>Both manuscripts naturally have readings peculiar to themselves. <i>B</i> has
about fifty unique readings. It places iii 11-12 after 13-14, omits v
37-40, and interchanges viii 49-50 and 51-52. At iv 34 <i>B</i> alone has
<i>erunt</i> (for <i>erit</i>), conjectured by Heinsius; <i>C</i> omits the word.
Similarly, at xi 21 <i>B</i> and <i>F<sup>1</sup></i> have <i>mihi</i>, omitted by <i>C</i>; the other
manuscripts have <i>tibi</i>. <i>B</i> has <i>ab</i> at i 9 for the other manuscripts'
<i>in</i>; <i>ab</i> is possibly the true reading.</p>

<p>Under the influence of Ehwald, modern editors have wrongly taken some of
<i>B</i>'s other readings to be correct, placing <i>aspicerem</i> in the text for
<i>prospicerem</i> at ix 23, <i>ara</i> for <i>ora</i> at ix 115, and <i>illi</i> for
<i>illum</i> at ix 126. At ix 73 editors print <i>B</i> and <i>T</i>'s <i>quem</i>, which is
clearly an interpolation for the awkward transmitted reading <i>qua</i>.</p>

<p>Unlike <i>C</i>, <i>B</i> has been quite heavily corrected by later hands.</p>

<p><i>C</i> has more than one hundred readings peculiar to itself. Two of them I
have accepted as correct: <i>summo</i> (for <i>summum</i>; <i>H</i> has <i>mundum</i>) at
iii 32, and <i>horas</i> (that is, <i>oras</i>) at vii 1; the reading is also
given by <i>I</i>. It is possible that <i>C</i>'s <i>correptior</i> should be read at
xii 13 for <i>correptius</i>. At xiv 38 <i>C</i>'s <i>sceptius</i> is the manuscript
reading closest to the correct <i>Scepsius</i> restored by Scaliger.</p>

<p>Most of <i>C</i>'s errors are trivial, but at some points it departs widely
from the usual text. It omits ix 47 and xiv 37, and interchanges the
second hemistichs of iii 26 and 28; xvi 30 is inserted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> by a later hand,
perhaps in an erasure. At viii 43 it has <i>in uita</i> for <i>officio</i>, at
xiii 12 <i>contra uiam</i> for <i>nouimus</i>, at xiv 36 <i>in</i> for <i>loci</i>, and at
xv 31 <i>colloquio</i> for <i>uerum quid</i>.</p>

<p><i>C</i> also contains a greater number of purely palaeographical errors than
any other manuscript: <i>hunc</i> for <i>nunc</i> (i 25), <i>humeris</i> for <i>numeris</i>
(ii 30), <i>hec</i> for <i>nec</i> (ix 30), <i>lucos</i> for <i>sucos</i> (x 19), <i>hasto</i>
for <i>horto</i> (xv 7), <i>ueiiuolique</i> for <i>ueliuolique</i> (xvi 21), <i>pretia</i>
for <i>pr(o)elia</i> (xvi 23).</p>

<p><i>B</i> and <i>C</i> sporadically offer the third declension accusative plural
ending <i>-is</i> (ix 4 <i>fascis</i> <i>C</i>, ix 7 <i>partis</i> <i>C</i>, ix 73 <i>rudentis</i>
<i>B</i>, x 17 <i>cantantis</i> <i>B</i>, xii 30 <i>albentis</i> <i>B</i>). But more usually all
manuscripts, including <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, have the accusative in <i>-es</i>:
compare for example ii 27 <i>partes</i>, iii 53 <i>purgantes</i>, ix 35
<i>praesentes</i>, and ix 42 <i>fasces</i>. The manuscripts show a similar
variation in the earlier books of the <i>Ex Ponto</i>. The ninth-century
Hamburg manuscript (<i>A</i>) sometimes offers accusatives in <i>-is</i> where the
other manuscripts, even <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, have <i>-es</i> (I iv 23 <i>partis</i>, I v
11 <i>talis</i>, I vi 39 <i>ligantis</i>, I vi 51 <i>turris</i>). At I ii 4, <i>A</i> has
<i>omnes</i>, where <i>C<sup>1</sup></i> has <i>omnis</i>, and in general even in <i>A</i> the
accusative in <i>-es</i> is the predominant form. For example, <i>A</i> offers
<i>auris</i> at II iv 13 and II ix 25, but <i>aures</i> at I ii 127, I ix 5, II v
33, and II ix 3. In view of the instability of the manuscript
evidence<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, I have normalized the ending to <i>-es</i> in all cases,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
considering the instances of <i>-is</i> to be scribal interpolations.</p>

<p>Similarly, I have used the form <i>penna</i> at iv 12 and vii 37, where <i>C</i>
offers <i>pinna</i>. <i>Penna</i> is the form given in the ancient manuscripts of
Virgil, and attested by Quintilian.</p>


<h4><i>MFHILT</i></h4>

<p>The other manuscripts I have collated belong to the vulgate class. They
are not related to each other in the sense that <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> are related,
nor does any of them possess independent authority as does <i>G</i>. Within
the group firm lines of affiliation are hard to establish, and each of
the manuscripts attests a handful of good readings that are found in few
or none of the others, either by happy conjecture, or because a reading
that was in circulation at the time as a variant chanced to get copied
into a few surviving manuscripts. Professor R. J. Tarrant has noted that
the presence of the <i>Ex Ponto</i> in north-central France 'can be traced
from the eleventh century onwards, first from echoes in Hildebert of
Lavardin and Baudri de Bourgeuil, later from the extracts in the
<i>Florilegium Gallicum</i>, and finally from the complete texts [which
include our <i>H</i> and <i>F</i>] ... that emanate from this region toward the end
of the twelfth century' (<i>Texts and Transmission</i> 263); the vulgate
manuscripts seem to have been propagated from the text current in the
region of Orl&eacute;ans.</p>

<p><i>M</i> and <i>F</i> show some originality. Their readings at xvi 33 differ
somewhat from the version of that passage in <i>HILT</i>. <i>F<sup>1</sup></i>'s
interpolation for the missing pentameter at iii 44 differs from that of
<i>MHILT</i>, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> <i>M</i> has an interpolated distich following x 6 that is
not otherwise attested.</p>

<p>Of the other manuscripts, <i>I</i> agrees with <i>C</i> in reading <i>horas</i>
(=<i>oras</i>) for <i>undas</i> at vii 1, while <i>T</i> is the only manuscript
collated to have the correct <i>laeuus</i> at ix 119 in the original hand
(<i>F<sup>2</sup></i> gives it as a variant reading). Similarly, <i>H</i> and <i>L</i> each have a
few peculiar variants.</p>

<p>As a group <i>MFHILT</i> offer a good picture of the readings current in the
later mediaeval period, and only rarely have I been obliged to cite a
vulgate manuscript from the editions of Heinsius, Burman, or Lenz as
testimony for a variant.</p>


<h4><i>M</i></h4>

<p>Heinsius did not have knowledge of <i>B</i> or <i>C</i>, and seems to have
considered his <i>codex Moreti</i> (preserved at the Museum Plantin-Moretus
in Antwerp as 'Latin, n&deg; 68 [anc. 43] [salle des reliures, n&deg; 32]' in
Denuc&eacute;'s catalogue of the museum's collection) to be the best of the
poor selection of manuscripts available; at xvi 33, understandably
despairing of restoring the true reading, he accepted <i>M</i>'s reading
pending the discovery of better manuscripts.</p>

<p><i>M</i> was dated by Heinsius to the twelfth or thirteenth century; Denuc&eacute;
assigns it to the twelfth century.</p>

<p>At viii 85 <i>M</i> alone has the correct <i>ullo</i> for the other manuscripts'
<i>illo</i>; this could naturally have been recovered by conjecture. At x 1
it has <i>cumerio</i>, the closest reading in the manuscripts collated to
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> correct <i>Cimmerio</i>; but Professor R. J. Tarrant informs me that
<i>Cimmerio</i> is also found in <i>British Library Harley 2607</i>.</p>

<p><i>M</i> has suffered from a certain degree of interpolation. Following x 6
there is the spurious distich <i>set cum nostra malis uexentur corpora
multis / aspera non possum perpetiendo mori</i>. At ii 9 <i>Falerno</i> is a
deliberate alteration of <i>Falerna</i>. At x 49 <i>Niphates</i> is an
interpolation from Lucan III 245. At xiii 47 <i>duorum</i> (also given as a
variant reading by <i>F<sup>2</sup></i>) looks like an attempt to correct the cryptic
transmitted reading <i>deorum</i>, and at xv 15 <i>tellus regnata</i> is
presumably a metrical correction following the loss of <i>-que</i> from
<i>regnataque terra</i>, the reading of the other manuscripts. At xvi 25
<i>eticiusque</i> looks to be a deliberate alteration of <i>Trinacriusque</i>, but
I am not sure what the interpolation means.</p>


<h4><i>F</i></h4>

<p><i>Francofurtanus Barth 110</i>, used by Burman, shows some signs of
independence. At iii 44, where a pentameter has been lost, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>
omit the line, while the other manuscripts, including <i>M</i>, have the
interpolation <i>indigus effectus omnibus ipse magis</i>; <i>F</i> has the
separate interpolation <i>Achillas Pharius abstulit ense caput</i>, also
found in Heinsius' <i>fragmentum Louaniense</i>. <i>F</i> omits viii 51-54, at xi
1 reads <i>Pollio</i> for <i>Gallio</i>, and at xvi 33 has a reading somewhat
different from those offered by the other manuscripts.</p>

<p><i>F</i> alone of the manuscripts collated offers the correct <i>audisse</i> (for
<i>audire</i>) at x 17. At xi 21 it and <i>B</i> alone have the correct <i>mihi</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
for <i>tibi</i> (omitted by <i>C</i>). At xiv 7 it has the probably correct
<i>muter</i> for <i>mittar</i>, also found in <i>Bodleianus Canon. lat. 1</i> and
<i>Barberinus lat. 26</i>, both of the thirteenth century. With the exception
of <i>muter</i>, these readings could have been recovered by conjecture;
given the separative interpolation at iii 44, <i>F</i> differs surprisingly
little from the other manuscripts.</p>


<h4><i>H</i></h4>

<p>The thirteenth-century <i>Holkhamicus 322</i>, now <i>British Library add.
49368</i>, contains (with <i>I</i>) the correct <i>hanc</i> at i 16, the other
manuscripts having <i>ha</i>, <i>ah</i> (<i>B</i>), or <i>a</i> (<i>C</i>). At xvi 30, where I
have printed <i>leuis</i>, the reading of most manuscripts, <i>H</i> has <i>leui</i>,
the conjecture of Heinsius; Professor R. J. Tarrant informs me that the
same reading is found in <i>Othob. lat. 1469</i>. At iv 45 <i>H</i>'s <i>qua libet</i>
is the manuscript reading closest to Heinsius' correct <i>quamlibet</i>; most
manuscripts have <i>quod licet</i>.</p>

<p>Most other variants in <i>H</i> are trivial errors, although there seems to
have been deliberate scribal alteration at x 18 (<i>sucus amarus erat</i> for
<i>lotos amara fuit</i>), xiv 38 (<i>Celsius</i> for the usual <i>Septius</i>; Scaliger
restored <i>Scepsius</i>), xvi 3 (<i>ueniet</i> for <i>uenit et</i>; presumably the
intermediate step was <i>uenit</i>), and perhaps at xiv 31 (<i>miserabilis</i> for
<i>uitabilis</i>).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>


<h4><i>I</i></h4>

<p>The thirteenth-century <i>Laurentianus 36 32</i>, Lenz's and Andr&eacute;'s <i>m</i>, has
the correct <i>perstas</i> at x 83 for <i>praestas</i>; its reading is also found
in <i>P</i> and as a variant of <i>F<sup>2</sup></i>. At vii 1 it shares with <i>C</i> the reading
<i>horas</i> (=<i>oras</i>), which I have printed in preference to the usual
<i>undas</i>.</p>

<p>At viii 15 <i>I</i> has the hypercorrect <i>nil</i> for <i>nihil</i>, and at xiii 26
<i>ethereos ... deos</i> for <i>aetherias ... domos</i>, but in general has few
signs of deliberate alteration.</p>


<h4><i>L</i></h4>

<p><i>Lipsiensis bibl. ciu. Rep. I 2&deg; 7</i>, of the thirteenth century, has
<i>haec</i> at ix 103 for the other manuscripts' <i>et</i>. <i>Haec</i> restores sense
to the passage, and was the preferred reading of Heinsius; I consider it
a scribal conjecture, now rendered obsolete by Professor R. J. Tarrant's
more elegant <i>quae</i>. <i>L</i>'s text has clearly been tampered with at xiv 41
(<i>populum ... uertit in iram</i> for <i>populi ... concitat iram</i>), but in
general seems to have suffered little from interpolation. It is,
however, of little independent value as a witness to the text.</p>


<h4><i>T</i></h4>

<p><i>Turonensis 879</i>, written around the year 1200, was first fully collated
by Andr&eacute; for his edition; Lenz had earlier reported its readings for IV
xvi and part of I i. At ix 119 only <i>T</i> and <i>F<sup>2</sup></i> of the manuscripts
collated have the correct <i>laeuus</i>, although other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> manuscripts come
close, and the reading could have been recovered by conjecture. At xv 40
<i>T</i> reads <i>transierit saeuos</i> for <i>transit nostra feros</i>; clearly
<i>nostra</i> was at some point lost from the text, and metre forcibly
restored.</p>


<h4><i>P</i></h4>

<p>I have also collated the thirteenth-century <i>Parisinus lat. 7993</i>,
Heinsius' <i>codex Regius</i>. At ix 46 <i>P</i> offers the correct <i>cernet</i> for
<i>credet</i>; <i>cernet</i> is also the reading of <i>M</i> after correction by a
later hand and of the thirteenth-century <i>Gothanus membr. II 121</i>. At vi
7 <i>P</i> alone of collated manuscripts agrees with <i>C</i> in reading
<i>praestat</i> for the correct <i>perstat</i>. <i>P</i> agrees with <i>L</i> in reading
<i>niuibus</i> for the other manuscripts' <i>nubibus</i> at v 5, <i>adeptum</i> for
<i>ademptum</i> at vi 49, <i>signare</i> for <i>signate</i> at xv 11, and in the
orthography <i>puplicus</i> for <i>publicus</i> at ix 48, ix 102, xiii 5, and xiv
16. The manuscript has many corruptions: a few examples are i 30 <i>igne</i>
for <i>imbre</i>, ii 18 <i>supremo</i> for <i>suppresso</i>, iv 6 <i>pace</i> for <i>parte</i>,
vi 34 <i>uirtus</i> for <i>uirus</i>, vii 15 <i>piacula</i> for <i>pericula</i>, ix 42
<i>praeterea</i> for <i>praetextam</i>, x 63 <i>in harena</i> for <i>marina</i>, xiv 39
<i>conuiuia</i> for <i>conuicia</i>, and xvi 24 <i>sacri</i> for <i>scripti</i>. However,
<i>P</i> has no unique variants with any probability of correctness. To have
given a full report of <i>P</i> would have involved a considerable expansion
of an already long apparatus, and I have cited the manuscript only
occasionally, where a reading is only weakly attested by the other
manuscripts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>


<h4>Titles</h4>

<p><i>MF</i> and <i>B<sup>2</sup>H<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup>T<sup>2</sup></i> usually supply titles for the poems. As will be seen
from the apparatus, there is considerable variation among the titles,
and there is no reason to suppose that they form an authentic part of
the transmitted text.</p>


<h4>The manuscript authority for the text of <i>Ex Ponto</i> IV</h4>

<p>By and large the manuscripts of the fourth book of the <i>Ex Ponto</i> offer
a remarkably uniform text of the poems, and one which, considering the
late date of the manuscripts, is in surprisingly good condition. I
believe that all the manuscripts, with the exception of <i>G</i>, are
descended from a single archetype. <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> are the best witnesses to
the text of the archetype, although the other, more heavily contaminated
and interpolated manuscripts are indispensable, since they correct the
peculiar errors of <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>.</p>


<h4>The present edition</h4>

<p>The apparatus of this edition is intended to be a full report of
<i>BCMFHILT</i> and of the fragmentary <i>G</i>; some reports are also given of
<i>P</i>. It includes corrections by original and by later hands.</p>

<p>When no manuscripts are specified for the lemma in an entry, the lemma
is the reading for those manuscripts not otherwise specified. For
instance, the entry</p>

<p>deductum carmen] carmen deductum <i>M</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>indicates that <i>deductum carmen</i> is the reading of <i>BCFHILT</i>, while
<i>carmen deductum</i> is the reading of <i>M</i>.</p>

<p>I have from time to time cited from earlier editions readings of
manuscripts which I have not collated. To make it clear that I have not
personally verified these readings, I have added in parentheses after
the citation the name of the editor whose report I am using. Professor
R. J. Tarrant has inspected some nine manuscripts to see what readings
they offered in some particularly vexed portions of the poems; I have
similarly indicated when I am obliged to him for information on a
manuscript.</p>

<p>The <i>excerpta Scaligeri</i> mentioned at xiii 27 I know of through
Heinsius' notes as printed in Burman's edition; according to M. D. Reeve
(<i>RhM</i> CXVII [1974] 163), the original excerpts are still extant in Diez
8&deg; 2560, a copy of the <i>editio Gryphiana</i> of 1546. Reeve also gives
identifications of certain of Heinsius' manuscripts; when citing
Heinsius' codices, I give the modern name when the manuscript has been
identified and is still extant.</p>

<p>The greater number of the manuscripts dealt with have been corrected,
some heavily. In my apparatus <i>B<sup>1</sup></i> means "the original hand in <i>B</i>" and
<i>B<sup>2</sup></i> means "a correcting hand in B". <i>B<sup>2ul</sup></i> indicates that the reading
of <i>B<sup>2</sup></i> is clearly marked as a variant reading. <i>B<sup>2gl</sup></i> indicates that
the entry is marked in the manuscript as a gloss; <i>B<sup>2(gl)</sup></i> indicates a
gloss not marked as such. I have reported glosses where they contribute
to the understanding of a textual problem.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>If different correctors have been at work in different passages, both
are called <i>B<sup>2</sup></i>. If a later hand has made a correction after <i>B<sup>2</sup></i>, the
later hand is called <i>B<sup>3</sup></i>. When I place <i>B<sup>1</sup></i> in an entry but do not
report <i>B<sup>2</sup></i>, it can be assumed that <i>B<sup>2</sup></i> has the lemma as its reading.</p>

<p>Sometimes a corrector has altered the original text so much (without
however erasing it entirely) that only the altered reading can be made
out. In such cases I have used the siglum <i>B<sup>2c</sup></i>.
Where a corrector has inserted or altered only certain letters of
a word, I have indicated this in the HTML version of this edition
by underlining the letters involved. In the Text version, these
letters are capitalized.</p>

<p>Where the correction is apparently by the original scribe, <i>B<sup>ac</sup></i>
indicates the original reading, and <i>B<sup>pc</sup></i> the correction.</p>

<p>The asterisk is used to indicate illegible letters, and the solidus (/)
erasures.</p>

<p>When reporting variants, I have tried to indicate the spellings actually
found in the manuscripts, but since mediaeval spellings do not in
themselves constitute variant readings, they have not usually been
reported when the text is not otherwise disturbed. I have been more
generous with proper names, but have often excluded confusions of <i>ae</i>,
<i>oe</i>, and <i>e</i>, of <i>i</i> and <i>y</i>, of <i>ph</i> and <i>f</i>, of <i>c</i> and <i>t</i>, the
doubling of consonants, and the loss or addition of the aspirate.</p>

<p>The apparatus is intended to include a comprehensive listing of all
conjectures proposed. When the author of a conjecture is not a previous
editor of the poems, I have given a reference either to the publication
where the emendation was first proposed, or to the earliest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> edition I
have consulted which reports the emendation. Conjectures of Bentley are
from Hedicke's <i>Studia Bentleiana</i>. Conjectures of Professor R. J.
Tarrant, Professor J. N. Grant, and Professor C. P. Jones were
communicated to me by their authors.</p>


<h4>Printed editions</h4>

<p>The first editions of the works of Ovid were printed in 1471 by
Balthesar Azoguidus at Bologna and by Conradus Sweynheym and Arnoldus
Pannartz at Rome. The Bologna edition was edited by Franc. Puteolanus,
and the Rome edition by J. Andreas de Buxis. Lenz's edition gives
numerous readings from both editions; to judge from his reports, their
texts of the <i>Ex Ponto</i> were derived from late manuscripts of no great
value. The Roman edition, however, contained the elegant correction of
<i>iactate</i> to <i>laxate</i> at ix 73.</p>

<p>For my knowledge of other early editions of the <i>Ex Ponto</i> I have relied
upon Burman's large variorum edition of the complete works of Ovid,
published at Amsterdam in 1727. The edition contains notes of various
editors of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, among them
Merula, Naugerius, Ciofanus, Fabricius, and Micyllus. Although I have
occasionally quoted from these notes, they are in general of
surprisingly little use, containing for the most part unlikely variant
readings from unnamed manuscripts and explanations of passages not
really in need of elucidation.</p>

<p>The principal event in the history of the editing of the <i>Ex Ponto</i> was
the appearance at Amsterdam in 1652 of Nicolaus Heinsius'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> edition of
Ovid. Heinsius took full advantage of the opportunity his travels as a
diplomat gave him of searching out manuscripts, thereby gaining a direct
knowledge of the manuscripts of the poems which has never since been
equalled<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>. Heinsius also possessed an unrivalled felicity in
conjectural emendation. Some of his conjectures are unnecessary
alterations of a text that was in fact sound, some of his necessary
conjectures are trivial, and are already found in late manuscripts of
the poems or could have been made by critics of less outstanding
capacities; but many are alterations which are subtle and yet necessary
to restore sense or Latinity. The present edition returns to the text
many conjectures and preferred readings of Heinsius that were ejected by
editors of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p>

<p>The edition of Heinsius formed the basis of all editions published
during the two centuries that followed. Of these editions the most
important was the 1727 variorum edition of Burman already referred to.
It is from the copy of that edition at the University of Toronto Library
that I have obtained my knowledge of Heinsius' notes. Burman was
apparently the first editor to make use of <i>F</i>. On occasion he differs
from Heinsius in his choice of readings. At xvi 44 he made the
convincing conjecture <i>Maxime</i> (codd <i>maxima</i>),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> subsequently confirmed
by <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>. His notes are informative; and my note on x 37-38 in
particular is greatly indebted to him.</p>

<p>For poem x Burman reproduced some notes from an anthology of Latin verse
for use at Eton, produced by an anonymous editor in 1705<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.</p>

<p>In 1772 Theophilus Harles published at Erlangen his edition of the
<i>Tristia</i> and <i>Ex Ponto</i> 'ex recensione Petri Burmanni'. Harles was the
first editor to make use of <i>B</i>. In the introduction to his edition
Harles relates how he wrote von Oeffele, librarian to the Elector of
Bavaria, asking if there was any manuscript in the Elector's library
that might be helpful in preparing his edition, and thereby learned of
the existence of <i>B</i>. It is clear from Harles' introduction that he
fully appreciated the manuscript's importance; and in his notes he gives
many of its readings, pointing out where it confirmed suggestions of
Heinsius and Burman. However, his text is simply reprinted from Burman's
variorum edition.</p>

<p>W. E. Weber's text of <i>Ex Ponto</i> IV in his 1833 <i>Corpus Poetarum
Latinorum</i> is in effect a reprint of the Heinsius-Burman vulgate, except
that at viii 59 he prints the manuscripts' incorrect accusative form
<i>Gigantes</i> (Heinsius <i>Gigantas</i>). But this fidelity to the vulgate text
seems not to have been the editor's intention: in his introduction he
speaks of 'Heinsianae emendationes felices saepe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> superuacuae saepius
... quarum emendationum partem Mitscherlichius eiecit [G&ouml;ttingen, 1796; I
have not seen the edition], maiorem eiicere Iahnius coepit [Leipzig,
1828: the part of the edition containing the <i>Ex Ponto</i> was never
published]. dicendum tamen, etiamnunc passim haud paucas fortasse latere
Heinsii et aliorum correctiones minus necessarias in uerbis Ouidianis,
quas accuratior codicum inter se comparatio, opus sane immensi laboris,
extrudet'. It would be understandable enough if Weber, faced with the
labour of editing the entire corpus of Latin poetry, found himself
unable to effect a radical revision of the text of the <i>Ex Ponto</i>.</p>

<p>In 1853 there appeared at Leipzig the third volume of Rudolf Merkel's
first Teubner edition of the works of Ovid, containing his text of the
<i>Ex Ponto</i>. The part of Merkel's introduction dealing with the <i>Ex
Ponto</i> is entirely concerned with describing the appearance,
orthography, and readings of the ninth-century <i>Hamburgensis scrin. 52
F</i>. The manuscript ends, however, at III ii 67, and Merkel says nothing
of the basis for his text of the later poems, which in general is the
Heinsius-Burman vulgate.</p>

<p>In 1868 B. G. Teubner published at Leipzig Otto Korn's separate edition
of the <i>Ex Ponto</i>. Korn's apparatus is the first to have a modern
appearance; but this appearance is deceptive, for of the twenty sigla
Korn uses, ten are for individual or several manuscripts collated by
Heinsius, and only five are for manuscripts collated by Korn himself.
The edition is important, since Korn was the first editor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> to make
substantial use of <i>B</i> in constituting his text. Usually he printed the
text of <i>B</i> in preference to the vulgate: 'Ceterum eas partes in quibus
<i>A</i> caremus, &#946; [=<i>B</i>] libri uestigia secutus restitui, prorsus
neglectis recentiorum exemplarium elegantiis, quorum ad normam N.
Heinsius, cuius in tertio quartoque libro R. Merkelius assecla est,
textum conformauit' (xv).</p>

<p>There was some reason to review critically the vulgate established by
Heinsius and Burman. Even Heinsius was capable of error; examples of
this in <i>Ex Ponto</i> IV include his preference for the inelegant <i>idem</i>
for <i>ille</i> at iii 17, for the impossible <i>ullo</i> instead of the better
attested <i>nullo</i> at v 15, and for the obvious interpolation <i>domitam
... ab Hercule</i> at xvi 19 instead of <i>domito ... ab Hectore</i>. His most
pervasive fault is a partiality for elegant but unnecessary emendation:
often he is guilty of rewriting passages which are in themselves
perfectly sound. A typical instance is vii 30: Heinsius' <i>globos</i> is
elegant enough, but there is no reason to suspect the transmitted
<i>uiros</i>.</p>

<p>Some of the readings proposed or preferred by Heinsius had been
unnecessary or wrong, but many had been necessary to make sense of the
text; and Korn is often guilty of damaging the text by excluding
readings not found in <i>B</i>. The supreme example of this is his
restoration of the manuscripts' reading <i>iactate</i> for <i>laxate</i> at ix 73.</p>

<p>Korn used the collation of <i>B</i> by Harles, which had errors and omissions
(in his preface Harles had warned that his report might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> contain
errors<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>), so that at i 9 Korn prints <i>in istis</i> and at x 83
<i>perstas</i>, without noting in his apparatus that <i>B</i>'s false readings
were <i>ab istis</i> and <i>praestas</i> respectively. He was aware that at xi 21
<i>B</i> read <i>mihi</i>, but printed <i>tibi</i> nonetheless, although Burman had
already explained why <i>mihi</i> was the correct reading.</p>

<p>A curious feature of Korn's edition is its dual apparatus: below the
report of manuscript variants is a listing of passages where his text
differs from those of Heinsius and Merkel: 'Lectiones discrepantes
editionum Heinsii et Merkelii adposui, ut et quantopere Ouidius
Heinsianus a genuina forma discrepet dilucide perspiciatur, et quibus
locis a Merkelio discesserim facilius adpareat' (xxxii). Korn ejects
such obviously correct readings as <i>leuastis</i> at vi 44 and <i>laxate</i> at
ix 73; in each instance the true reading is printed in large type at the
bottom of the page. In addition, Korn rather unfairly included as
different readings what were in fact only spellings which did not
conform to the purified orthography then coming into use. <i>Cymba</i> does
not differ from <i>cumba</i> (viii 28), nor is <i>Danubium</i> a variant for
<i>Danuuium</i> (ix 80), nor again is <i>Vlysses</i> different from <i>Vlixes</i> (x
9). Finally, the second apparatus at several points misrepresents what
Heinsius actually thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Korn's confusion on this point is understandable, since determining
Heinsius' textual preferences is often more difficult than it might at
first appear. Editions were published under his name which did not
incorporate all his preferred readings<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>; even the lemmas to his notes
are taken from the edition of Daniel Heinsius, and are not a guide to
Heinsius' own view of the text, which can only be discovered by reading
the actual notes<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. A good example of this can be found at x 47. Here
Heinsius' text reproduces the standard reading <i>Cratesque</i>. The lemma in
his note is <i>Oratesque</i>, the reading of Daniel Heinsius' edition. In the
note itself Heinsius indicates his preference for the conjecture
<i>Calesque</i>, communicated to him by his friend Isaac Vossius. Here Korn,
along with all modern editors, prints <i>Calesque</i> in his text; he reports
<i>Cratesque</i> as Heinsius' reading.</p>

<p>Korn made one important conjecture in <i>Ex Ponto</i> IV, printing <i>decretis</i>
at ix 44 for the manuscripts' <i>secretis</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>For the third volume of his complete edition of Ovid, published at
Leipzig in 1874, Alexander Riese drew on Korn's edition, but was less
radical in following the readings of <i>B</i>: 'nec eclecticam quam dicunt N.
Heinsii nec libri optimi rigide tenacem O. Kornii rationem ingressus
mediam uiam tenere studui' (vii). Riese restores Heinsius' preferred
reading in only about a quarter of the places where it was deserted by
Korn; even so, no editor since has shown such independence in the
selection of readings.</p>

<p>In 1881 there appeared at London a text of <i>Ex Ponto</i> IV with
accompanying commentary by W. H. Williams. The text, which Williams says
is drawn from the "Oxford variorum edition of 1825", seems in general to
be a reprint of the Heinsius-Burman vulgate with some readings drawn
from Merkel's first edition. In spite of occasional conjectures and
notes on variant readings, based on information drawn from Burman and
Merkel, Williams is not generally concerned with the constitution of the
text: his note on x 68 <i>curasque fefelli</i> is 'so Tennyson in the "In
Memoriam'". The commentary, which is about eighty pages long, consists
largely of discussions of the cognates of various Latin words in other
Indo-European languages, 'though the limits of the work preclude more
than the <i>data</i> from which a competent teacher can deduce the principles
of comparative philology'. A typical note is that on i 11 <i>scribere</i>:
'from [root] skrabh = to dig, whence scrob-s and scrofa = 'the grubber,'
<i>i.e.</i> the pig; Grk. &#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#969; by loss of sibilant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> and
softening'. The edition has been only occasionally useful in editing the
poems or writing the commentary.</p>

<p>In 1884 Merkel published his second edition of the poems of exile. In
his previous edition he had in general followed Heinsius and Burman in
the fourth book; in the new edition, without specifically saying so
(although in his introduction he mentions the "codex Monacensis
uetustior"), he generally alters his text so as to conform with <i>B</i>'s
readings. He does not always desert his former text, rightly retaining
<i>hanc</i> at i 16, <i>quamlibet</i> at iv 45, and <i>tempus curasque</i> at x 67; he
also keeps <i>lux</i> at vi 9 and <i>domitam ... ab Hercule</i> at xvi 19.</p>

<p>In his 1874 monograph <i>De codicibus duobus carminum Ouidianarum ex Ponto
datorum Monacensibus</i> Korn had made known the existence of <i>C</i>. S. G.
Owen's first edition of the <i>Ex Ponto</i>, printed in Postgate's <i>Corpus
Poetarum Latinorum</i> in 1894, was the first edition to report this
manuscript as well as <i>B</i>. His text is unduly partial to the readings of
<i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, and his well-organized apparatus is so abbreviated as to be
deceptive. It cannot be relied upon even for reports of <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>. At
ix 73 it gives no hint that for four centuries editors had read
<i>laxate</i>; many of Heinsius' preferred readings are similarly consigned
to oblivion. At vi 5-6 he reports Housman's ingenious repunctuation,
presumably communicated to him by its author.</p>

<p>In 1896 Rudolf Ehwald published his monograph <i>Kritische Beitr&auml;ge zu
Ovids Epistulae ex Ponto</i>. I am often indebted to Ehwald for references
he has collected; my notes on i 15 <i>ad summam</i> and xiii 48<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> <i>quos laus
formandos est tibi magna datos</i> could not have been written without the
assistance of his monograph. This said, the fact remains that Ehwald's
judgment and linguistic intuition were exceptionally poor. He had not
relied on Korn's apparatus for his knowledge of <i>B</i>, but had collated it
himself; and the intent of his monograph was to establish <i>B</i>'s
authority as paramount. A typical example can be seen at ix 71. Here
<i>FILT</i> offer <i>cum ... uacabit</i> and <i>MH</i> have <i>ut ... uacabit</i>, while the
reading of <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> is <i>quod uacabit</i>. In one of the examples Ehwald
adduces, <i>Fast</i> II 18, <i>uacat</i> is found in only a few manuscripts, and
it can easily be seen how it arose from <i>uacas</i>; all the other examples
are instances of <i>quod superest</i> or <i>quod reliquum est</i>. The cumulative
effect of these examples is to demonstrate that <i>quod ... uacabit</i> is not
a possible reading. This insensitivity to the precise meaning of the
passages he discusses is usual with Ehwald, and his book, although
useful, is an extremely unsafe guide to the textual criticism of the
poems. It has unfortunately exercised a decisive influence on all
succeeding editions.</p>

<p>The first of these editions was Owen's 1915 Oxford Classical Text of the
poems of exile. In the preface Owen acknowledges the influence of
Ehwald: "adiumento primario erat R. Ehwaldi, doctrinae Ouidianae iudicis
peritissimi, uere aureus libellus ... in quo excussis perpensisque
codicibus poetaeque locutione ad perpendiculum exacta rectam Ponticarum
edendarum normam uir doctus stabilire instituit' (viii). In most
instances Owen follows Ehwald's recommendations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> altering <i>in</i> to <i>ab</i>
at i 9, <i>prospicerem</i> to <i>aspicerem</i> at ix 23, and at ix 44 abandoning
Korn's <i>decretis</i> for the manuscripts' <i>secretis</i>.</p>

<p>Owen's reliance on Ehwald was noticed by Housman (903-4) in his short
and accurate review of Owen's edition: 'In the <i>ex Ponto</i> Mr Owen had
displayed less originality [than in his 1889 and 1894 editions of the
<i>Tristia</i>] and consequently has less to repent of. Most of the changes
in this edition are made in pursuance of orders issued by R. Ehwald in
his <i>Kritische Beitr&auml;ge</i> of 1896; but let it be counted to Mr Owen for
righteousness that at III.7.37 and IV.15.42 he has refused to execute
the sanguinary mandates of his superior officer'.</p>

<p>As in Owen's earlier edition, the apparatus is so short as to be
misleading. His choice of manuscripts is too small, and exaggerates the
importance of <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>; even of these two manuscripts his report is
inadequate. At ix 73 he rightly prints <i>laxate</i>; the apparatus gives no
indication that this is a conjecture, and that all manuscripts,
including <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, read <i>iactate</i>, which he had printed in 1894. At
xi 21, where <i>B</i> gives <i>mihi</i>, indicated by Burman as the correct
reading, Owen prints <i>tibi</i> and does not mention the variant in the
apparatus. The situation is naturally worse with readings of manuscripts
other than <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, and with conjectures. In general, Owen's
apparatus can be trusted neither as a report even of the principal
readings of the few manuscripts he used, or as a register of critics'
views of the constitution of the text.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same year as Owen's second text there appeared at Budapest Geza
N&eacute;methy's commentary on the <i>Ex Ponto</i>, of which twenty-six pages are
devoted to the fourth book. The notes are too sparse and elementary to
form an adequate commentary, consisting largely of simple glosses. They
are a useful supplement to a plain text of the poems, however, and
N&eacute;methy sometimes notices points missed by others: he correctly glosses
<i>Augusti</i> as "Tiberii imperatoris" at ix 70. The notes are based on
Merkel's second edition; N&eacute;methy lists in a preface his few departures
from Merkel's text.</p>

<p>In 1922 Friedrich Levy published his first edition of the <i>Ex Ponto</i> as
part of a new Teubner edition of the works of Ovid. The apparatus was a
reduced version of that prepared by Ehwald, 'Qui ut totus prelis
subiceretur ... propter saeculi angustias fieri non potuit'. Levy's text
is virtually identical to Owen's, but the apparatus is more complete. It
contains a full report of <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, and also of the
thirteenth-century <i>Gothanus memb. II 121</i>. This last manuscript has the
correct <i>cernet</i> at ix 46, where most manuscripts read <i>credet</i>; but
otherwise its readings are of very poor quality, consisting of simple
misreadings (i 24 <i>magnificas</i> for <i>munificas</i>, vii 30 <i>uento</i> for
<i>uenit</i>, viii 37 <i>habendus</i> for <i>abunde</i>), simplified word order (vi 25
<i>tuas lacrimas pariter</i> for <i>tuas pariter lacrimas</i>, xvi 39 <i>et iuuenes
essent</i> for <i>essent et iuuenes</i>), and intrusive glosses (viii 61
<i>captiuis</i> for <i>superatis</i>, xvi 47 <i>me laedere</i> for <i>proscindere</i>). The
manuscript does not deserve the important place it has in the editions
of Levy, Luck,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> and Andr&eacute;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>; Ehwald presumably included it in his
apparatus because of its easy accessibility to him at Gotha, where he
lived. No other manuscripts are regularly reported, so Levy's apparatus
gives a false impression of the evidence for the text, although he often
reports isolated readings from the manuscripts of Heinsius.</p>

<p>Levy omitted conjectures 'quatenus falsae uel superuacuae uidebantur';
the result is that Korn's elegant <i>decretis</i> does not appear even in the
apparatus at ix 44, and the same fate befalls Scaliger's <i>coactus</i> at
xiii 27.</p>

<p>In 1924 the Loeb Classical Library published A. L. Wheeler's text and
translation of the <i>Tristia</i> and <i>Ex Ponto</i>. His text is based on
Merkel's second edition, on Ehwald's <i>Beitr&auml;ge</i>, and on Owen's Oxford
Classical Text. In several places he rightly abandons <i>B</i>'s reading,
printing <i>hanc</i> for <i>ah</i> at i 16 and <i>perstas</i> for <i>praestas</i> at x 83;
at iv 45 he was clearly tempted to print Heinsius' <i>quamlibet</i>. His
judgment is good, and if Ehwald and Owen had supplied him with more
information on other manuscripts and on the Heinsius-Burman vulgate, his
text might well have superseded all previous editions. His translation
is accurate, and in corrupt passages indicates the awkwardness of the
original; I have often quoted from it.</p>

<p>In 1938 there appeared the elaborate Paravia edition of F. W. Levy, who
in the period following his earlier edition had altered his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> name to F.
W. Lenz. The text is virtually unchanged from his edition of 1922, but
has a much larger apparatus, which includes a large number of
conjectures omitted from the earlier edition; I am indebted to Lenz for
many of the conjectures I report, particularly at xvi 33. The large size
of the apparatus is, however, deceptive; most of the manuscripts he knew
of only from the reports of Heinsius, Korn and Owen, and the reports are
therefore incomplete: the only manuscripts reliably reported are <i>B</i> and
<i>C</i>. Since Lenz does not usually give the lemma for the variants
reported, it is difficult to tell which manuscripts offer the reading in
the text. Much space is wasted by reports of the readings of several
heavily interpolated mediaeval florilegia; more is wasted by an undue
attention to mediaeval spellings and attempts to reproduce abbreviations
and to show the precise appearance of secondary corrections. These
factors combine to render the apparatus virtually unreadable.</p>

<p>In 1963 Georg Luck published the Artemis edition of the <i>Tristia</i> and
<i>Ex Ponto</i>, with a German translation by Wilhelm Willige. Luck shows
some independence from Lenz, at i 16 printing <i>hanc</i> for <i>ah</i>, at iii 27
<i>sed et</i> for <i>subito</i>, at viii 71 <i>mauis</i> for <i>maius</i>, at viii 86
<i>distet</i> for <i>distat</i>, at ix 73 <i>laxate</i> for <i>iactate</i>, at xii 13
<i>producatur</i> for <i>ut dicatur</i>, and at xiv 7 <i>muter</i> for <i>mittar</i>, each
time rightly. He suggests a new conjecture for the incurable xvi 33, and
a new and possibly correct punctuation of xii 19. The apparatus is
misleading, consisting of isolated readings from <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> and a small
number of readings from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> other manuscripts. No indication is given that
<i>hanc</i> at i 16 or <i>pars</i> at i 35 are found only in a few manuscripts,
and not in <i>B</i> or <i>C</i>. Luck criticizes modern editors for ignoring the
discoveries of their predecessors, and rightly prints Heinsius'
<i>Gigantas</i> (codd <i>-es</i>) at viii 59. However, he shows no direct
knowledge of Heinsius' notes or of the Burman vulgate, making no mention
of such readings as <i>Gete</i> for <i>Getae</i> at iii 52, <i>leuastis</i> for
<i>leuatis</i> at vi 44, or <i>fouet</i> for <i>mouet</i> at xi 20. The oldest edition
named in his apparatus is that of Riese.</p>

<p>In 1977 F. Della Corte published an Italian translation of the <i>Ex
Ponto</i> with an accompanying commentary, of which fifty-eight pages are
devoted to the fourth book. Most of the commentary consists of extended
paraphrase of the poems; I have found it of little assistance.</p>

<p>The most recent text of the <i>Ex Ponto</i> is the 1977 Bud&eacute; edition of
Jacques Andr&eacute;. His text is essentially that of Lenz, although at ix 23
he rightly prints <i>prospicerem</i> instead of <i>B</i>'s <i>aspicerem</i>. There are
a significant number of misprints in the text, apparatus, and notes, and
other signs of carelessness as well.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; makes full reports of only four manuscripts in his apparatus, <i>B</i>,
<i>C</i>, <i>T</i>, and <i>Gothanus membr. II 121</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. This is an inadequate
sampling. <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> form a distinct group, and the Gotha manuscript
is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> too corrupt to merit a central part in an apparatus. The result is
that <i>T</i> is the sole good representative of the vulgate class of
manuscripts that is regularly cited.</p>

<p>For knowledge of many of his secondary manuscripts, Andr&eacute; seems to have
depended on the edition of Lenz. Since much of Lenz's information was
drawn from Heinsius and other earlier editors, this means that Andr&eacute; is
often giving unverified information from collations made more than three
centuries previously. He did not realize that the Antwerp manuscript he
collated (our <i>M</i>) was Heinsius' <i>codex Moreti</i>, whose readings Lenz
sometimes reports; the result is that he reports the same manuscript
twice, under the sigla <i>M</i> and <i>N</i>.</p>

<p>At ix 127 he cites the sixth-century Wolfenb&uuml;ttel fragment in support of
the unassimilated spelling <i>adscite</i> (the assimilated form <i>ascite</i> is
supported by the inscriptions and by the ancient manuscripts of Virgil).
In fact, the word is not found in the fragment, which preserves only the
first three letters of the line.</p>

<p>Finally, Andr&eacute; shows insufficient knowledge of the Heinsius-Burman
vulgate; this is evident not only from the text but from the
introduction, where he prefaces his list of principal editions by saying
'Nous ne mentionnerons que les editions fond&eacute;es sur des principes
scientifiques, dont la premi&egrave;re est celle de R. Merkel, Berlin, 1854'
(the edition was published at Leipzig in 1853).</p>

<p>In spite of what I have said against it, Andr&eacute;'s edition has
considerable merit. His apparatus is the first to supply a lemma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> for
each variant reading reported, and is clear and easy to read. His
selection of manuscripts is inadequate, but at least he makes a full
report of the four manuscripts he uses. The apparatus is in every way a
great improvement on that of Lenz. At the same time, he provides a clear
prose translation, an informative introduction, ample footnotes, and
thirteen pages of "notes compl&eacute;mentaires". His notes sometimes come
close to forming a true commentary, and I often quote from them.</p>

<p>In preparing this edition of the fourth book of the <i>Ex Ponto</i>, I have
carefully read all the editions discussed above, and have attempted to
include a comprehensive list of conjectures in the apparatus. I have
read Burman's variorum edition with particular attention, and have often
restored readings favoured by Heinsius to the text. A complete
examination of the manuscripts must await a full edition of all four
books of the <i>Ex Ponto</i>; but on the basis of published editions I have
selected the nine manuscripts that appeared most likely to assist in
establishing the text, and have included full reports of their readings
in the critical apparatus. I believe that even this preliminary
apparatus gives a clearer picture of the evidence for the text of <i>Ex
Ponto</i> IV than any previous edition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="COMMENTARY" id="COMMENTARY"></a>COMMENTARY</h2>


<p><b>EPISTVLARVM EX PONTO LIBER QVARTVS.</b> The precise title of
these poems is uncertain. The one mention Ovid makes of the poems' title
is of little assistance: 'inuenies, quamuis non est miserabilis index, /
non minus hoc illo triste quod ante dedi' (<i>EP</i> I i 15-16). The earliest
manuscript of the poems, the ninth-century <i>Hamburgensis scrin. 52 F</i>
(extant to III ii 67), gives no title at the start of the poems, but has
'EX PONTO LIBER &middot;II&middot; EXPLICIT' at the end of the second book. Later
manuscripts generally call the poems the <i>De Ponto</i> or <i>Epistulae de
Ponto</i>. The original name was probably not present in the archetype;
these titles were perhaps invented with the aid of the first distich of
the first poem: 'Naso Tomitanae iam non nouus incola terrae / hoc tibi
<i>de Getico litore</i> mittit opus'. Heinsius strongly preferred <i>Ex Ponto</i>
to <i>De Ponto</i> ('nihil magis inscitum aut barbarum hac inscriptione'),
citing in its support the first line of <i>Tr</i> V ii 'Ecquid, ut <i>e Ponto</i>
noua uenit epistula, palles'. In reality <i>ex</i> and <i>de</i> are equally
acceptable Latin (Cic <i>Att</i> XV xxvi 5; <i>Fam</i> XIV xx), but <i>Ex Ponto</i> is
the title found in the oldest manuscript of the poems and has become
usual since Heinsius' time; in the absence of further evidence it may be
allowed to stand.</p>

<p>Heinsius made two other suggestions for the poems' title. The first,
<i>Pontica</i>, seems best suited for a poem describing the geography of the
area around Tomis or the characteristics of its inhabitants. His second
suggestion, <i>Epistulae Ponticae</i>, is attractive, but without any
particular probability.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="I_To_Sextus_Pompeius" id="I_To_Sextus_Pompeius"></a>I. To Sextus Pompeius</h2>


<p>Sextus Pompeius, <i>consul ordinarius</i> in AD 14, is the most illustrious
of Ovid's correspondents in the <i>Ex Ponto</i>; patron of Valerius Maximus,
he was related to Pompey the Great (Sen <i>Ben</i> IV 30 2) and to Augustus
(Dio LVI 29 5). For discussions of his career, see Syme <i>HO</i> 156-62,
Pauly-Wissowa XXI,2 2265 61, and Dessau <i>PIR</i> P 450. He is the recipient
of four poems in the fourth book, but is nowhere mentioned in the first
three books of the <i>Ex Ponto</i>. Since Pompeius helped Ovid during his
journey to exile (v 31-38), their relationship must have been of long
standing; clearly Pompeius had indicated to Ovid his preference not to
be mentioned in his verse, even after it had become clear to most of
Ovid's friends that being named by him would carry no penalty. In <i>EP</i>
III vi, Ovid exhorts a timid friend to allow him to name him; there is
no indication, however, that the poem was addressed to Pompeius.</p>

<p>Ovid seems to have been best served in exile by those of his friends who
were of no particular eminence. In <i>Tr</i> III iv 3-8 &amp; 43-44 he complains
not only of the treatment he has received from Augustus, but also of the
lack of assistance from those of his friends most in a position to help.
Once Sextus Pompeius had indicated he was willing to be named publicly,
Ovid could not ignore the influence that a man of such position could
bring to bear; hence the number of poems addressed to him in the fourth
book.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Ovid starts the poem with an elaborate assertion of his past and present
desire to mention Pompeius in his verse (1-22), and then briefly
recounts the services Pompeius has rendered to him, and will continue to
render (23-26). The reason he is confident that Pompeius will continue
to assist him is that Pompeius' past assistance has been such that he is
now, in effect, Pompeius' creation, and brings glory to him in the way
that great works of art do for their creators (27-36).</p>

<p><b>1. DEDVCTVM.</b> 'Composed'. <i>Deducere</i> is often used in reference to the
drawing of fibres from the wool on the distaff and the shaping of the
thread (Catullus LXIV 311-14). From this meaning derive the two senses
the word can have when referring to poetry, 'composed' and 'finely spun,
delicate'. The first sense is seen here and at <i>Tr</i> I i 39, <i>EP</i> I v 13,
and at <i>Tr</i> V i 71 'ipse nec emendo, sed ut hic <i>deducta</i> legantur', and
the second at <i>Ecl</i> VI 4-5 'pastorem, Tityre, pinguis / pascere oportet
ouis, <i>deductum</i> dicere carmen', where <i>deductum ... carmen</i> represents
the &#924;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#945;&#957; ... &#955;&#949;&#960;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#941;&#951;&#957;
of Callimachus <i>Aetia</i> I 24; Servius
comments on the metaphor from spinning. It has been suggested that <i>Met</i>
I 4 'ad mea perpetuum <i>deducite</i> tempora carmen' shows this meaning as
well; see Kenney <i>Ouidius Prooemians</i> 51-52.</p>

<p>Hor <i>Ep</i> II i 225 'tenui deducta poemata filo' stands somewhere between
the two senses.</p>

<p><b>2. DEBITOR ... VITAE.</b> See v 33-36 (Ovid's letter speaking to Pompeius)
'te sibi, cum fugeret, memori solet ore referre / barbariae tutas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
exhibuisse uias, / sanguine Bistonium quod non tepefecerit ensem, /
effectum cura pectoris esse tui'. The passage suggests that Pompeius
supplied Ovid with a bodyguard for his journey overland from Tempyra to
Tomis, either in an official capacity&mdash;Dessau suggests (<i>PIR</i> P 450)
that Pompeius might have been proconsul of Macedonia&mdash;or, more probably,
from his Macedonian estates, for which Dessau and Syme (<i>HO</i> 157) cite
xv 15.</p>

<p><b>3. QVI.</b> Williams' CVI is possibly correct; the line would then refer to
the <i>titulus</i> of the poem in a published text.</p>

<p><b>3. SEV NON PROHIBES.</b> 'If you do not try to prevent'. The context makes
it clear that Pompeius will not in fact prevent Ovid from mentioning
Pompeius in his poem. This conative sense is much more commonly found
with the imperfect than with the present; the only way it can be
dispensed with in this passage is if <i>cui</i> is read and, as Professor R.
J. Tarrant suggests, <i>prohibes</i> taken to refer to the later inclusion of
the poem in a published collection.</p>

<p><b>4. ACCEDET MERITIS.</b> Pompeius' even allowing Ovid to name him would count
as a favour. Nowhere in the poem does Ovid specify why Pompeius might
prefer not to be named.</p>

<p><b>4. ACCEDET MERITIS HAEC QVOQVE SVMMA TVIS.</b> 'This sum will be added to
the favours you have done me'. Professor J. N. Grant points out to me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>the technical terms of finance used in the passage: <i>debitor ... accedet
... summa</i>. I once thought that <i>summa</i> was equivalent in sense to
<i>cumulus</i> ('addition') at <i>EP</i> II v 35-36 'hoc tibi facturo, uel si non
ipse rogarem, / <i>accedat cumulus</i> gratia nostra leuis', but have found
no parallel for this sense of <i>summa</i>.</p>

<p><b>5. TRAHIS VVLTVS.</b> 'Frown'&mdash;compare iii 7 'contraxit uultum Fortuna',
viii 13-14 'ei mihi, si lectis uultum tu uersibus istis / ducis', <i>Am</i>
II ii 33 'bene uir traxit uultum rugasque coegit', and <i>Met</i> II 774
'ingemuit uultumque una ac [<i>Housman</i>: ima ad <i>codd</i>] suspiria duxit'.</p>

<p><b>5-6. EQVIDEM PECCASSE FATEBOR, / DELICTI TAMEN EST CAVSA PROBANDA MEI.</b>
'Yes, I shall certainly confess my guilt, but the reason for my offence
is one that necessarily wins approval'. Ovid uses the correct legal
terminology; compare Cic <i>Mur</i> 62 <i>'fatetur</i> aliquis se <i>peccasse</i> et
sui [<i>Halm</i>: cui <i>uel</i> eius <i>codd</i>] <i>delicti</i> ueniam petit'. Other
instances in Ovid of <i>peccasse fateri</i> at hexameter-ends are <i>Am</i> III
xiv 37, <i>Met</i> III 718, VII 748 &amp; XI 134, and <i>EP</i> II iii 33.</p>

<p>For Ovid's close acquaintance with the law see at xv 12 (<a href="#Page_434">pp 434-35</a>).</p>

<p><b>7. NON POTVIT MEA MENS.</b> Compare <i>Tr</i> V ix 25-26 'nunc quoque se, quamuis
est iussa quiescere, quin te / nominet inuitum, uix mea Musa tenet'.</p>

<p><b>8. OFFICIO.</b> Used again of Ovid's writing of verse-epistles at <i>Tr</i> V ix
33-34 'ne tamen <i>officio</i> memoris laedaris amici, / parebo iussis&mdash;parce
timere&mdash;tuis'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p><b>8. OFFICIO ... PIO.</b> The words similarly combined at <i>Tr</i> III iii 84 and
<i>Tr</i> V vi 4 'officiique pium ... onus'. The adjective ('loyal') is a
favourite term of commendation in the poems of exile, applied to <i>fides</i>
(<i>Tr</i> V xiv 20, <i>EP</i> III ii 98), coupled with <i>memor</i> (<i>Tr</i> IV v 18, V
iv 43), or used to characterize the inseparable friends of myth such as
Theseus and Pirithous (<i>Tr</i> I ix 31) or Castor and Pollux (<i>Tr</i> IV v
30).</p>

<p><b>9.</b> IN. <i>B</i>'s AB is possibly correct, <i>ab istis</i> meaning 'to judge by
them, on the basis of their evidence'. Professor R. J. Tarrant cites
Prop III iii 38 'ut reor <i>a facie</i>, Calliopea fuit'.</p>

<p><b>11. ALII VELLEM CVM SCRIBERE.</b> The line confirms that Ovid was not at
liberty to name Sextus Pompeius in his poems even after he had begun the
composition of the first three books of the <i>Ex Ponto</i>.</p>

<p>Ovid similarly indicates his frustrated desire to name his correspondent
at <i>Tr</i> IV v 10 'excidit heu nomen quam mihi paene tuum' and at <i>EP</i> III
vi 1-2 'Naso suo (posuit nomen quam paene!) sodali / mittit ... hoc breue
carmen'.</p>

<p><b>11. VELLEM CVM.</b> <i>B</i> offers CVM VELLEM, which I take to be a simple
corruption to prose word-order. It is however the reading printed by
Owen; and it could be argued that <i>cum uellem</i> is the correct reading,
and was altered to <i>uellem cum</i> for metrical reasons. Lucretius and
Catullus were fond of placing a spondaic word in the fourth foot of the
hexameter; in the Augustan age practice altered, and the pattern was
generally avoided; compare <i>Aen</i> I 1 'Arma uirumque cano, <i>Troiae qui</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
primus ab oris'. It was, however, permitted occasionally, especially
when the previous foot ended in a long monosyllable (Platnauer 20-22).
Scribes quite often alter such lines so as to remove the spondaic word
from coinciding with the fourth foot; an instance of this can be seen at
line 7 'non potuit mea mens quin esset grata teneri', where <i>H</i> offers
the scribal alteration <i>esset quin</i>. For a full discussion see Housman
269.</p>

<p><b>13. MENDIS.</b> This is probably a form of <i>mendum</i> rather than of <i>menda</i>;
compare Cic <i>II Ver</i> II 104 'quid fuit istic antea scriptum? quod
<i>mendum</i> ista litura correxit?' and <i>Att</i> XIII xxiii 2 ' tantum
librariorum <i>menda</i> tolluntur'. I have found no earlier instance in
verse of <i>mendum</i> meaning 'error' in this sense; Ovid in his poems of
exile uses the terms of his craft more readily than any of his
predecessors.</p>

<p><b>14. VIX INVITA FACTA LITVRA MANV EST.</b> <i>Vix</i> goes with <i>facta</i>; Andr&eacute;
seems to take it with <i>inuita</i> ('ma main l'effa&ccedil;ait presque &agrave; regret').</p>

<p><b>15. VIDERIT</b> is a complete sentence meaning 'let him look to himself'.
Compare the following examples: 'nona terebatur miserae uia; <i>"uiderit</i>
[<i>sc</i> Demophoon]" inquit / et spectat zonam pallida facta suam' (<i>RA</i>
601-2), '"uiderit! insanos" inquit "fateamur amores"' (<i>Met</i> IX 519),
'cur tamen est mihi cura tui tot iam ante peremptis? / <i>uiderit</i>!
intereat, quoniam tot caede procorum / admonitus non est' (<i>Met</i> X
623-25), '<i>uiderit</i>! audentes forsque deusque iuuat' (<i>Fast</i> II 782),
'<i>uideris</i>! [<i>cod Ambrosianus G 37 sup (saec xiv), sicut coni
Heinsius</i>:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> uiderit <i>codd plerique</i>] audebo tibi me scripsisse fateri'
(<i>EP</i> I ii 9). The idiom is found with an expressed subject at <i>AA</i> II
371 '<i>uiderit</i> Atrides: Helenen ego crimine soluo' and <i>AA</i> III 671-72
'<i>uiderit</i> utilitas: ego coepta fideliter edam: / Lemniasin gladios in
mea fata dabo'. It is clearly derived from the use of <i>uiderit</i> 'look
after, take care of' with an expressed object, as at <i>Her</i> XII 209-11
'quo feret ira sequar! facti fortasse pigebit&mdash; / et piget infido
consuluisse uiro. / <i>uiderit</i> ista deus qui nunc mea pectora uersat!'.
Although <i>uiderit</i> in these passages clearly has a jussive sense, it is
probably future perfect in origin, since <i>uidero</i> 'I shall look after'
is quite frequent in Terence and Cicero: see Martin on Ter <i>Ad</i> 437 'de
istoc ipse uiderit' and <i>OLD uideo</i> 18b.</p>

<p><b>15. AD SVMMAM</b> means 'in short' or 'to sum up', and is used to introduce
a recapitulation of what has just been expressed or concluded. The line
should therefore be taken as the end of a debate which Ovid has had with
himself. For the idiom, Ehwald (<i>KB</i> 45) cites Cic <i>Att</i> VII vii 7, XIV
i 1, Hor <i>Ep</i> I i 106 'ad summam, sapiens uno minor est Ioue, Petronius
<i>Sat</i> 37 5 'ad summam, mero meridie si dixerit illi tenebras esse,
credet', 37 10, 57 3 &amp; 9, 58 8 (in all these passages the narrator's
neighbour at table is the speaker) and 71 1 (Trimalchio speaking).
Professor R. J. Tarrant cites Sen <i>Apoc</i> 11 3 'ad summam, tria uerba
cito dicat et seruum me ducat'.</p>

<p>AD SVMMVM is the reading of <i>L</i> and <i>T</i> and is printed by Burman (who
punctuates <i>uiderit ad summum</i>) and Merkel (<i>ad summum dixi</i>). <i>OLD
summus</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> 8b gives only one instance of <i>ad summum</i>, where it means 'at
most' (Scribonius Largus 122). The phrase does not seem appropriate to
the present context.</p>

<p><b>15. IPSE</b> (<i>FTP</i>) is so much better in sense ('although <i>he</i> may object')
than the ILLE of most manuscripts that I have followed all previous
editors in accepting it.</p>

<p><b>16. HANC.</b> This, the reading of <i>H</i> and <i>I</i> (perhaps recovered by
conjecture), must be preferred to HA (AH, A), the reading of the other
manuscripts, since without it <i>licet ipse queratur</i> would have to be
linked to <i>uiderit</i>, which seems awkward. The corruption of <i>h&#257;c</i> to
<i>ha</i> is not difficult, especially in view of the following <i>pudet</i>;
compare <i>Met</i> IX 531 'pudet, a pudet edere nomen'.</p>

<p><b>17. SI QVID EA EST.</b> 'If it really exists'. The affirmation would be 'est
aliquid Lethe'; compare Prop IV vii 1 'Sunt aliquid Manes: letum non
omnia finit'.</p>

<p><b>17. HEBETANTEM PECTORA.</b> I have found no other instance in Ovid of this
transferred sense of <i>hebetare</i>, but compare <i>Aen</i> II 604-6 'omnem quae
nunc obducta tuenti / mortalis hebetat uisus tibi ... nubem eripiam' and
<i>Aen</i> VI 731-32. The transferred sense is found at Celsus II i 11
'Auster aures hebetat ... omnis calor ... mentem hebetat'; compare as well
Pliny <i>NH</i> XVIII 118 '[faba ...] hebetare sensus existimata' and Suet
<i>Cl</i> 2 'animo simul et corpore hebetato'.</p>

<p><i>Oblitus</i> in 18 indicates that <i>pectus</i> is virtually equivalent to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
'mind' or even 'memory'. In Ovid it often has the sense 'poetic
feeling', as at xii 16 'pectus habere neger'.</p>

<p><b>17. LETHEN.</b> Compare <i>Tr</i> IV i 47-48 'utque soporiferae biberem si pocula
Lethes, / temporis aduersi sic mihi sensus abest'.</p>

<p><b>21. ET</b> can be construed, as connecting with the preceding <i>nec</i>; compare
<i>Fast</i> VI 325 '<i>nec</i> licet <i>et</i> longum est epulas narrare deorum'. SED
should however possibly be read, the word contrasting with the preceding
<i>nec</i> as at ii 15-16 'nec tamen ingenium nobis respondet ut ante, /
<i>sed</i> siccum sterili uomere litus aro'. The error could easily be
induced by the final <i>s</i> of the preceding <i>putes</i>; compare <i>Med</i> 55-56
'par erui mensura decem madefiat ab <i>ouis</i> / (<i>sed</i> [<i>uar</i> et] cumulent
libras hordea nuda duas)'.</p>

<p><b>21. LEVIS HAEC ... GRATIA.</b> 'This unimportant expression of gratitude'.
The same use of <i>leuis</i> at <i>EP</i> II v 35-36 'hoc tibi facturo, uel si non
ipse rogarem, / accedat cumulus gratia nostra leuis'.</p>

<p><b>21. HAEC MERITIS REFERATVR GRATIA.</b> Similar phrasing at <i>Met</i> V 14-15
'meritisne haec gratia tantis / redditur?', <i>Tr</i> V iv 47 'plena tot ac
tantis referetur gratia factis', <i>EP</i> I vii 61 'emeritis referenda est
gratia semper', and <i>EP</i> III i 79-80 'nec ... debetur meritis gratia
nulla meis'.</p>

<p><b>23. NVMQVAM PIGRA FVIT NOSTRIS TVA GRATIA REBVS.</b> Wheeler rightly points
out Ovid's play in 21-23 on the varying senses of <i>gratia</i> (thanks),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
<i>gratus</i> (grateful), and <i>gratia</i> (favour, kindness).</p>

<p><b>26. FERETQVE</b> is Heinsius' correction for the REFERTQVE of the
manuscripts (REFERT <i>B<sup>1</sup></i>, REFERTA <i>C</i>); it is made necessary by the
following <i>fiducia tanta futuri</i>. Owen, Lenz, and Andr&eacute; report
<i>feretque</i> as the reading of the thirteenth-century <i>Canonicianus lat
1</i>, but Professor R. J. Tarrant, who has examined the manuscript,
informs me that it in fact reads <i>refertque</i>.</p>

<p>For the pattern compare <i>Tr</i> III viii 12 'quae non ulla tibi <i>fertque
feretque</i> dies' and <i>Tr</i> II 155-56 'per superos ... qui <i>dant</i> tibi longa
<i>dabuntque</i> / tempora'.</p>

<p>The corruption was natural enough, particularly in view of such passages
as <i>Fast</i> VI 334 'errantes <i>fertque refertque</i> pedes', <i>Tr</i> I vii 5-6
(to a friend who owned a ring with Ovid's portrait) 'hoc tibi ... senti
... dici, / in digito qui me <i>fersque refersque</i> [<i>codd</i>: ferasque
<i>Heinsius</i>] tuo', and <i>Tr</i> V xiii 29 'sic <i>ferat ac referat</i> tacitas
nunc littera uoces'.</p>

<p><b>28. QVOD FECIT QVISQVE TVETVR OPVS.</b> 'Everyone protects the work he has
created'. This is hardly a commonplace of ancient poetry, and the
catalogue which follows of famous works of art does not serve to
illustrate it.</p>

<p><b>29-34.</b> Ovid's description of the works of Apelles, Phidias, Calamis, and
Myron was influenced by Propertius' catalogue of artists at III ix 9-16;
in particular, he imitates 10-12 'exactis Calamis se mihi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> iactat equis;
/ in Veneris tabula summam sibi poscit Apelles; / Parrhasius parua
uindicat arte locum', and 15 'Phidiacus signo se Iuppiter ornat eburno'.
Professor E. Fantham points out to me the inclusion of Apelles, Calamis,
and Myron as canonical figures in a catalogue of artists at Cic <i>Brut</i>
70 and of all four in a similar catalogue at Quint XII x 6-9.</p>

<p><b>29. VENVS.</b> Ovid is speaking of the famous Aphrodite Anadyomene painted
by Apelles (fourth century BC) in Cos; hence the epithet <i>Coi</i> later in
the line&mdash;Apelles was in fact from Colophon. Ovid had probably seen the
picture in Rome, for Augustus brought it there from Cos (Strabo XIV 2
19; Pliny <i>NH</i> XXXV 91).</p>

<p>Ovid refers to the painting at <i>Am</i> I xiv 33-34 and <i>Tr</i> II 527-28. At
<i>AA</i> III 223-24 (quoted in the next note) Ovid seems to be describing a
cut gem copied from the painting.</p>

<p><b>30. AEQVOREO MADIDAS QVAE PREMIT IMBRE COMAS.</b> <i>Imbre</i> depends on
<i>madidas</i>. <i>Premit</i> is equivalent to <i>exprimit</i>, as is shown by <i>AA</i> III
224 'nuda Venus madidas <i>exprimit</i> imbre comas'. For <i>exprimere</i> taking
as object that out of which something is pressed or squeezed see Celsus
IV 24 and Pliny <i>NH</i> XXIX 31.</p>

<p>The Romans would not have found <i>aequoreo ... imbre</i> strange. Although
the primary transferred sense of <i>imber</i> would be rain-water, it is used
of sea-water as early as Ennius <i>Ann</i> 497-98 Vahlen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> 'ratibusque
fremebat / imber Neptuni', and without defining qualifier at <i>Aen</i> I
123.</p>

<p><b>31. ACTAEAE</b> = the metrically difficult <i>Atheniensis</i>. The word is generally confined to high
poetry (<i>Ecl</i> II 24, <i>Met</i> II 554 &amp; 720, VI 711, VII 681 &amp; VIII 170),
but its first occurrence is in prose, at Nepos <i>Thras</i> 2 1 'hoc initium
fuit salutis Actaeorum'; some manuscripts read <i>Atticorum</i>, which may be
right.</p>

<p><b>31. VEL EBVRNA VEL AEREA CVSTOS.</b> There were at Athens two famous statues
of Athena sculpted by Phidias: 'Phidias ... fecit ex <i>ebore auroque</i>
[<i>Mayhoff</i>: aeque <i>codd</i>] Mineruam Athenis quae est in Parthenone stans,
ex <i>aere</i> uero ... Mineruam tam eximiae pulchritudinis ut formae cognomen
acceperit ['was named the Minerva Formosa']' (Pliny <i>NH</i> XXXIV 54); the
second, less famous statue is described at Pausanias I 28 2.</p>

<p>Heinsius' note is something of an oddity. He begins by reading AVREA for
the AENEA of most manuscripts, taking <i>uel eburna uel aurea custos</i> to
refer to the chryselephantine statue in the Parthenon, 'sed altius
consideranti locum apparet de duplici statua Mineruae agi, altera
eburnea, altera aenea'. <i>Aenea</i> therefore continued to be the accepted
reading until 1873, when Haupt (<i>Opuscula</i> 584) pointed out that it was
unmetrical, and restored <i>aerea</i>, found in some manuscripts.</p>

<p>The inverse error occurs at <i>Her</i> VI 32, where most manuscripts have the
unmetrical <i>aeripedes</i> for <i>aenipedes</i>. But Merkel, followed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> Palmer,
considered 31-38 an interpolation; and <i>aeripedes</i> may have been what
the interpolator wrote.</p>

<p><b>32. PHIDIACA ... MANV.</b> Ovid is recalling Prop III ix 15 'Phidiacus
... Iuppiter'. For the Latin poets' use of a personal adjective for the
genitive of the noun, see Austin's interesting note on <i>Aen</i> II 543
<i>Hectoreum</i>.</p>

<p><b>33. VINDICAT VT CALAMIS LAVDEM QVOS FECIT EQVORVM.</b> 'As Calamis lays
claim to the praise given his horses'. Calamis, a sculptor of the fifth
century BC, was particularly famous for his statues of horses; see Pliny
<i>NH</i> XXXIV 71 'habet simulacrum et benignitas eius ['Praxiteles'
generosity is seen in one of his statues']; Calamidis enim quadrigae
aurigam suum imposuit, ne melior in equorum effigie defecisse in homine
crederetur. ipse Calamis et alias quadrigas bigasque fecit equis sine
aemulo expressis'.</p>

<p><b>33. QVOS FECIT EQVORVM.</b> Similar instances of hyperbaton at 28 'quod
fecit quisque tuetur opus', <i>Met</i> IV 803 'pectore in aduerso quos fecit
sustinet angues', and <i>Fast</i> VI 20 'tum dea quos fecit sustulit ipsa
metus'.</p>

<p><b>34. VT SIMILIS VERAE VACCA MYRONIS OPVS.</b> The <i>Cow</i> of Myron (late fifth
century BC) was his most famous work. Praise of the statue's lifelike
appearance was a stock theme of Hellenistic writers of epigram; it
appears from Pliny <i>NH</i> XXXIV 57 that the poetry written about the
statue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> was as notable as the statue itself. Thirty-six poems of the
Palatine Anthology deal with the theme (IX 713-42 &amp; 793-98). Ausonius
wrote eight epigrams on the same subject (<i>Ep</i> LXVIII-LXXV), of which I
quote LXVIII as a typical example of what both the Greek and Latin
epigrams are like:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bucula sum, caelo <i>['chisel']</i> genitoris facta Myronis<br /></span>
<span class="i1">aerea: nec factam me puto, sed genitam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">sic me taurus init, sic proxima bucula mugit,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">sic uitulus sitiens ubera nostra petit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">miraris quod fallo gregem? gregis ipse magister<br /></span>
<span class="i1">inter pascentes me numerare solet.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The statue was in Athens during Cicero's lifetime (<i>II Verr</i> IV 135);
Ovid is likely to have seen it during his visit to the city (<i>Tr</i> I ii
77). He would certainly have seen the four statues of cattle sculpted by
Myron which Augustus placed in his temple of Apollo, and which
Propertius described: 'atque aram circum steterant armenta Myronis, /
quattuor artificis, uiuida signa, boues' (II xxxi 7-8).</p>

<p><b>35. VLTIMA.</b> 'Smallest, least important'. For this rare sense compare Hor
<i>Ep</i> I xvii 35 'principibus placuisse uiris non ultima laus est', <i>Cons
ad Liuiam</i> 44 'ultima sit laudes inter ut illa tuas', Vell Pat I 11 1,
and the other instances cited by <i>OLD ultimus</i> 9.</p>

<p><b>35. SVM</b> ('I am not the least of your possessions') seems unobjectionable
enough; most editors have, however, accepted PARS from the <i>excerpta
Politiani</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p><b>36. MVNVS OPVSQVE</b> is a Latin phrase with the general meaning of
'creation'. It is used in this sense at Cic <i>Tusc</i> I 70 'haec igitur et
alia innumerabilia cum cernimus, possumusne dubitare quin iis praesit
aliquis uel effector ... uel ... moderator tanti <i>operis et muneris</i>?',
<i>ND</i> II 90, <i>Off</i> III 4 'nulla enim eius ingenii [<i>sc</i> Africani] monumenta
mandata litteris, nullum <i>opus</i> otii, nullum solitudinis <i>munus</i> extat',
and <i>Met</i> VII 435-36 (to Theseus) 'quodque suis securus arat Cromyona
colonus, / <i>munus opusque</i> tuum est'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="II_To_Cornelius_Severus" id="II_To_Cornelius_Severus"></a>II. To Cornelius Severus</h2>


<p>Cornelius Severus (Schanz-Hosius 268-69 [&sect; 317]) was one of the most
famous poets contemporary with Ovid; of him Quintilian said 'etiam si
uersificator quam poeta melior ['even if his facility outruns his
inspiration'], si tamen (ut est dictum) ad exemplar primi libri bellum
Siculum perscripsisset, uindicaret sibi iure secundum locum [<i>sc</i> after
Virgil]' (X i 89). The elder Seneca quoted with approval Severus' lines
on the death of Cicero, as the finest lament produced on the subject
(<i>Suas</i> VI 26: Winterbottom <i>ad loc</i> refers to a commentary by H.
Homeyer, <i>Annales univ. Saraviensis [phil. Fak.]</i> 10 [1961], 327-34).
<i>EP</i> I viii was addressed to a different Severus: in the third and
fourth lines of the present poem, Ovid expresses his embarrassment at
having addressed no poem to Severus previously, and in the earlier poem
no mention is made of the addressee's poetry.</p>

<p>The poem is an apology to Severus for Ovid's not having sent a poem to
him before; he offers two excuses for the omission. In the first
fourteen lines, he flatters Severus by saying that so good a poet hardly
needs to receive verse from someone else; in the twenty-four lines that
follow he describes how his poetry, because of the conditions at Tomis,
is now less abundant and of poorer quality than before. The subject is
one Ovid had employed before: <i>Tr</i> III xiv, a request for indulgence to
Ovid's verse, and <i>Tr</i> V xii, a reply to a friend who had urged him to
write more poetry, treat the same topic in much the same way. The theme
is similar to that of Catullus LXVIII<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> 1-40, where the poet explains
that his brother's death has caused his lack of interest in poetry.</p>

<p>In 39-46 Ovid moves to the somewhat discordant topic (which serves
however to re-emphasize his misery at Tomis) of how he continues to
write poetry to take his mind off present evils, a theme he had used
several times before, most notably in <i>EP</i> I v. He ends the poem with a
request that Severus send him some of his recent work (47-50).</p>

<p><b>1. QVOD LEGIS.</b> Similar beginnings to verse-epistles at <i>Her</i> III 1
'<i>Quam legis</i> a rapta Briseide littera uenit', <i>Tr</i> V vii 1, <i>EP</i> I vii
1-2 'Littera pro uerbis tibi, Messaline, salutem / <i>quam legis</i> a saeuis
attulit usque Getis', and <i>EP</i> III v 1 '<i>Quam legis</i> unde tibi mittatur
epistula quaeris?'.</p>

<p>Compare as well <i>Her</i> X 3-4 '<i>Quae legis</i> ex illo, Theseu, tibi litore
mitto / unde tuam sine me uela tulere ratem'. This poem has suffered
from two separate interpolations at its beginning. Certain manuscripts
start the poem with the distich 'Illa relicta feris etiam nunc, improbe
Theseu, / uiuit et haec aequa mente tulisse uelis', which is universally
condemned; but the formulaic nature of 3-4 suggests that 1-2 'Mitius
inueni quam te genus omne ferarum, / credita non ulli quam tibi peius
eram', found in all manuscripts, is a second interpolation. Micyllus was
the first to see this; a recent discussion at Kirfel 69-70.</p>

<p><b>1. VATES MAGNORVM MAXIME REGVM.</b> Severus apparently wrote a poem dealing
with pre-Republican Rome, to judge from xvi 9 his most famous work:
'quique dedit Latio carmen regale, Seuerus'. Heinsius took the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> two
passages as meaning that Severus was a writer of tragedy, citing <i>Tr</i> II
553 'et dedimus tragicis scriptum regale cothurnis'; compare as well Hor
<i>Sat</i> I x 42-43 'Pollio regum / facta canit pede ter percusso ['in
iambic trimeter']'. Heinsius' suggestion is possible enough, but since
Seneca and Quintilian speak of Severus as an epic poet and there is no
mention of the stage in this poem, it should be rejected.</p>

<p>Similar language is used of epic poetry at <i>Ecl</i> VI 3 'cum canerem
<i>reges</i> et proelia' and Prop III iii 1-4 'Visus eram ... reges, Alba,
tuos et <i>regum facta</i> tuorum, / tantum operis, neruis hiscere posse
meis'.</p>

<p><b>1. REGVM.</b> VATVM (<i>M<sup>1</sup>FIL</i>) is a conscious or unconscious attempt to
extend the etymological figure seen in <i>magnorum maxime</i>.</p>

<p><b>5-6. ORBA TAMEN NVMERIS CESSAVIT EPISTVLA NVMQVAM / IRE PER ALTERNAS
OFFICIOSA VICES.</b> Other mentions of what was clearly an extensive prose
correspondence between Ovid and his friends at <i>Tr</i> V xii 1-2 and <i>EP</i> I
ix 1-2.</p>

<p><b>6. OFFICIOSA.</b> 'Attentive'. The preface to Martial XII gives a good
illustration of the sense: 'consequimur ut molesti potius quam ut
officiosi esse uideamur'.</p>

<p><i>Officiosus</i> occurs five times in the <i>Ex Ponto</i>, but only four times in
the rest of Ovid's poetry.</p>

<p><b>9-10.</b> Aristaeus was famous for his beekeeping (Virgil <i>G</i> IV 315-558).
Bacchus was the god of wine, and Triptolemus had disseminated the
knowledge of grain-farming (<i>Met</i> V 646-61). Alcinous might seem a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
strange companion to these three, but evidently Homer's description of
Alcinous' orchard (<i>Od</i> VII 112-31) made a strong impression on the
Latin poets. From Ovid compare <i>Am</i> I x 56 'praebeat Alcinoi poma
benignus ager' and <i>Met</i> XIII 719-20 'proxima Phaeacum felicibus obsita
pomis / rura petunt', from Propertius III ii 13 'nec mea Phaeacas
aequant pomaria siluas', and from Virgil <i>G</i> II 87 'pomaque et Alcinoi
siluae' 'the fruit-trees of Alcinous'.</p>

<p><b>9. BACCHO VINA FALERNA.</b> Heinsius preferred <i>M</i>'s BACCHO VINA FALERNO.
But the passage he cited in its support, Silius III 369-70 'Tarraco
... uitifera, et Latio tantum cessura Lyaeo' is not in fact parallel:
<i>Lyaeo</i> there stands for <i>uino</i>, and the passage means 'Tarraco, rich in
vines, conceding priority to Latin wine alone'. Ovid wished to balance
the hexameter with the pentameter, and used a standard epithet to fill
out the metre.</p>

<p><b>10. ALCINOO.</b> Note the quadrisyllable ending, and compare <i>EP</i> II ix
41-42 'quis non Antiphaten Laestrygona deuouet? aut quis / munifici
mores improbet <i>Alcinoi</i>?'. In his later poetry Ovid shows a steadily
increasing willingness to allow his pentameters to end with words other
than disyllables. Every pentameter of the amatory poems and the first
fifteen <i>Heroides</i> ends in a disyllable. Two quadrisyllabic endings
occur in the later books of the <i>Fasti</i>: V 582 <i>fluminibus</i> and VI 660
<i>funeribus</i>. In the first five books of the <i>Tristia</i> there are eight
such endings, in the first three books of the <i>Ex Ponto</i> there are
seven, while in the fourth book there are no less than fourteen
instances of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> quadrisyllabic endings: nearly as many as in all the rest
of Ovid's corpus put together.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> 'Sermo magis etiam quam illic [<i>sc</i>
in the <i>Tristia</i>] ... neglectus est et degenerauit' Riese remarked, but
it can reasonably be doubted that a poet of Ovid's facility would break
the rule of the disyllabic ending except by choice. A moderation of the
rule became general: the author of <i>Her</i> XVI-XXI (whom I do not believe
to have been Ovid) allowed <i>pudicitiae</i> (XVI 290), <i>superciliis</i> (XVII
16), and <i>deseruit</i> (XIX 202) (Platnauer 17); a count of pentameters in
Martial V shows the proportion of non-disyllabic endings at 20%&mdash;the
shorter the poem, the more freely they are admitted. Quadrisyllable
endings are frequent in the metrically strict Claudian.</p>

<p>Ovid admitted quadrisyllable endings more freely if they were proper
names. Of the twenty-one quadrisyllable verse-endings in the <i>Ex Ponto</i>,
six involve proper nouns: II ii 76 <i>Dalmatiae</i>, ix 42 <i>Alcinoi</i>, the
present passage, IV iii 54 <i>Anticyra</i>, viii 62 <i>Oechalia</i>, and ix 80
<i>Danuuium</i>. Professor E. Fantham points out to me that Ovid follows
Propertius' similar practice: 42 of the 166 quadrisyllable pentameter
endings in Propertius are proper names (Platnauer 17).</p>

<p>The fifteen other instances in the <i>Ex Ponto</i> of quadrisyllabic
pentameter-endings are II ii 6 <i>perlegere</i>, ii 70 <i>imperium</i>, iii 18
<i>articulis</i>, v 26 <i>ingenium</i>, III i 166 <i>aspiciant</i>, IV v 24 <i>officio</i>,
vi 6 <i>alterius</i>, vi 14 <i>auxilium</i>, ix 48 <i>utilitas</i>, xiii 28 <i>imperii</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
xiii 46 <i>ingeniis</i>, xiv 4 <i>inuenies</i>, xiv 18 <i>ingenio</i>, xiv 56
<i>imposuit</i>, and xv 26 <i>auxilium</i>.</p>

<p>For Ovid's use of trisyllabic and pentasyllabic endings, see at ix 26
<i>tegeret</i> (<a href="#Page_294">page 294</a>) and iii 12 <i>amicitia</i>
(<a href="#Page_181">p 181</a>).</p>

<p><b>11. FERTILE PECTVS HABES.</b> Compare <i>Tr</i> V xii 37-38 'denique non paruas
animo dat gloria uires, / et <i>fecunda</i> facit <i>pectora</i> laudis amor'.</p>

<p><b>11. INTERQVE HELICONA COLENTES.</b> Poets are also described as being on
Parnassus at <i>Tr</i> IV i 50, x 23 &amp; x 120. Helicon is the goal of poets at
Hor <i>Ep</i> II i 218 (cited at 36).</p>

<p><b>12. PROVENIT</b> continues the agricultural metaphor of <i>fertile pectus</i>.
For <i>prouenire</i> = 'grow', see <i>AA</i> III 101-2 'ordior a cultu: cultis
bene Liber ab uuis / prouenit', <i>Fast</i> IV 617 'largaque prouenit
cessatis messis in aruis', and <i>Nux</i> 10; for the metaphorical sense see
<i>Am</i> I iii 19-20 'te mihi materiem <i>felicem</i> in carmina praebe&mdash; /
<i>prouenient</i> causa carmina digna sua' and <i>Her</i> XV 13-14 'nec mihi
dispositis quae iungam carmina neruis / <i>proueniunt</i>'.</p>

<p>For <i>uberius ... prouenit</i> compare Caesar <i>BG</i> V 24 'eo anno frumentum in
Gallia propter siccitates <i>angustius prouenerat</i>'.</p>

<p><b>13. MITTERE AD HVNC CARMEN.</b> Burman printed without comment MITTERE
CARMEN AD HVNC, the reading of Heinsius' <i>fragmentum Louaniense</i>. It
seems to be a mere normalization of the hyperbaton; the elimination of
the elision (<i>mittere ad</i>) may have been a factor as well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p><b>13. AD HVNC</b> indicates that Ovid cannot have addressed these words in the
first instance directly to Severus, but must here be recollecting his
earlier thoughts. I have therefore placed the line in quotation marks.</p>

<p><b>15. NEC TAMEN.</b> 'This was the principal reason; a second reason, however,
was that ...'</p>

<p><b>15. INGENIVM</b> = 'poetic talent', as often. Compare viii 66, xvi 2, <i>Tr</i>
III vii 47, <i>EP</i> II ii 103, <i>EP</i> II v 21 (quoted at 20 <i>uena
pauperiore</i>), <i>EP</i> II v 26, and <i>EP</i> III iv 11.</p>

<p><b>15. RESPONDET</b> introduces the agricultural image of 18 'sed siccum
sterili uomere litus aro', for the word here means 'yield'. <i>OLD</i>
<i>respondeo</i> 8c cites for the literal sense Virgil <i>G</i> II 63-64 'truncis
oleae melius, propagine uites / respondent', Columella II 1 3 'humus ...
magno faenore ... colono respondet', Col III 3 4; for a transferred use
see Sen <i>Ep</i> LXXXI 1 'non respondeant [<i>sc</i> beneficia] potius quam non
dentur'.</p>

<p><b>16. SICCVM ... LITVS ARO.</b> Proverbial for a useless activity. See Otto
<i>harena</i> 4 and compare <i>Tr</i> V iv 47-48 'plena tot ac tantis referetur
gratia factis, / nec sinet ille [Ovid] litus arare boues'.</p>

<p><i>Sterili</i> is transferred by hypallage from <i>litus</i>; <i>siccum</i> serves no
purpose beyond providing a balancing epithet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p><b>17. VENAS EXCAECAT</b>, the reading of most codices, is obviously correct as
against the VENAS CVM CAECAT of <i>BCHL</i>. Ovid uses <i>excaecare</i> again at
<i>Met</i> XV 270-72 'hic fontes natura nouos emisit, at illic / clausit
... flumina prosiliunt aut <i>excaecata</i> [<i>uar</i> exsiccata] residunt'.</p>

<p><b>17. IN VNDIS</b> is probably corrupt; if it is retained, from the context it
must mean 'in the water of springs' (Professor A. Dalzell). Williams
suggests 'in the case of water', marking the analogy with <i>pectora sic
mea sunt limo uitiata malorum</i> in 19.</p>

<p>For <i>undis</i> as a corrupt hexameter ending, compare <i>Met</i> XV 276
'redditur Argolicis ingens Erasinus in aruis [<i>codd</i>: in undis <i>Sen</i> NQ
<i>III 26 4</i>]', <i>Met</i> VIII 162 'liquidus Phrygiis Maeandros in aruis
[<i>uar</i> liquidis Phrygius ... in undis]', and <i>Met</i> XIV 155 'sedibus
Euboicam Stygiis emergit in urbem [<i>uar</i> sedibus euboicis stigiis
emersus ab undis]'.</p>

<p>The line seems to have passed without comment until Merkel's second
edition: '<i>in undis</i> minus bene positum uidetur; temptabam <i>hiulcas,</i>
quod expressisset Statius Theb. VIIII 450 <i>hiulcis flumina uenis
Suggerit</i> ['he (the river Asopos) opens his springs wide and adds his
streams']'. There seems no obvious reason, however, for Ovid to define
the springs as 'gaping'.</p>

<p>Madvig conjectured INVNDANS, the corruption of which would be easy; but
<i>uenas</i> seems more in need of a modifier than <i>limus</i>&mdash;Professor R. J.
Tarrant suggests APERTAS or AQVARVM, Professor A. Dalzell IN ARVIS.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Professor Tarrant also suggests to me that <i>in undis</i> could well have
originated as a gloss on <i>uenas</i>.</p>

<p><b>18. LAESAQVE.</b> There seems no reason to replace this with Merkel's
LAPSAQVE ('flowing back'?), which even seems to contradict the sense of
<i>resistit</i>.</p>

<p>The same sense of <i>laesus</i> at <i>Am</i> III vii 32 'deficiunt laesi carmine
['spell'] fontis aquae'.</p>

<p><b>20. VENA PAVPERIORE.</b> The same image of Ovid's poetic talent at <i>Tr</i> III
xiv 33-34 'ingenium fregere meum mala, cuius et ante / fons infecundus
<i>paruaque uena</i> fuit' and <i>EP</i> II v 21-22 'ingenioque meo, <i>uena</i> quod
<i>paupere</i> manat, / plaudis, et e riuo flumina magna facis'.</p>

<p><b>23. DA VENIAM FASSO.</b> As a poet himself, Severus would be particularly
shocked at Ovid's admission he has virtually ceased to write poetry.
Similar phrasing at III ix 45-46 'confesso ignoscite, docti: / uilior
est operis fama salute mea'.</p>

<p><b>23. FRENA REMISI.</b> 'I have let go of the reins' = 'I have stopped writing
poetry'; for the sense, compare <i>Aen</i> VII 599-600 (of Latinus) 'nec
plura locutus / saepsit se tectis rerumque reliquit habenas'.</p>

<p>The metaphor of the poet as driver is found as early as Bacchylides (V
176-78) and Pindar (<i>Ol</i> VI 22 ff). A full list of Greek and Latin
passages is included in Henderson's note on <i>RA</i> 397-98; the image is
particularly frequent in Roman didactic poetry, being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> found even at
Columella X 215-16. See as well Kenney <i>Nequitiae Poeta</i> 206. In Ovid
the image is found at <i>AA</i> I 39-40 &amp; 264, II 426, III 467-68 &amp; 809-10,
<i>RA</i> 397-98, <i>Fast</i> I 25-26, II 360, IV 10, and VI 586. The only
instances I have found that are not from Ovid's didactic verse are the
present passage and xii 23-24 'tu bonus hortator, tu duxque comesque
fuisti, / cum regerem tenera frena nouella manu'.</p>

<p><b>24. DVCITVR.</b> 'Is formed, written'. The same sense at <i>Met</i> I 649 (of Io)
'<i>littera</i> ... quam pes in puluere <i>duxit</i>' and <i>Met</i> X 215-16 'AI AI /
flos habet inscriptum, funestaque <i>littera ducta</i> est'.</p>

<p><b>25. IMPETVS ILLE SACER.</b> 'The famous divine impulse'. Similar phrasing at
<i>Fast</i> VI 5-6 'est deus in nobis; agitante calescimus illo: / impetus
hic sacrae semina mentis habet'.</p>

<p><b>25. VATVM PECTORA NVTRIT.</b> <i>Nutrit</i> here seems to mean 'sustain'. Its
usual transferred sense is 'cause to grow', as at III iv 26 (the only
other passage I have found where the verb is used of poetry) and Hor <i>C</i>
IV iv 26.</p>

<p><b>27. VIX VENIT AD PARTES ... MVSA.</b> 'My Muse with difficulty performs her
functions'. <i>Partes</i> in the sense of 'theatrical role' (Ter <i>Ph</i> 27)
early acquired the extended sense of 'role', 'function', or 'duty'.
Burman cites as parallels <i>Am</i> I viii 87 'seruus et <i>ad partes</i> sollers
ancilla parentur' and <i>Nux</i> 68; compare as well <i>AA</i> II 546 'cum, tener,
<i>ad partes</i> tu quoque, somne, uenis' and <i>EP</i> III i 41-42 'utque iuuent
alii, tu debes uincere amicos, / uxor, et <i>ad partes</i> prima uenire
tuas'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p><b>27. SVMPTAE ... TABELLAE.</b> Compare <i>Met</i> IX 523-25 'scribit damnatque
<i>tabellas</i> ... inque uicem <i>sumptas</i> ponit positasque <i>resumit</i>'.</p>

<p><b>29. NE DICAM.</b> I have found no other instance of the expression in verse,
but it is common in Cicero (K&uuml;hner-Stegmann II i 825).</p>

<p><b>30. NVMERIS NECTERE VERBA.</b> 'Bind words to metre'. I take <i>numeris</i> as a
dative; no close parallel presents itself, but compare <i>Aen</i> IV 239-40
'pedibus talaria nectit / aurea'.</p>

<p><b>33. NVMEROSOS ... GESTVS.</b> Compare <i>Am</i> II iv 29 'illa placet <i>gestu
numerosaque bracchia</i> ducit', <i>AA</i> II 305 '<i>bracchia</i> saltantis, uocem
mirare canentis', and Prop II xxii 5-6 'siue aliquis molli diducit
candida <i>gestu</i> / bracchia, seu uarios incinit ore modos'. Heinsius
thought GRESSVS (<i>I<sup>1</sup>PF<sup>3ul</sup></i>) possible as well, citing Varro <i>LL</i> IX 5
'<i>pedes</i> male <i>ponere</i> atque imitari uatias ['bow-legged men']
coeperit', Martianus Capella IX 909 'licet pulchris rosea numeris ac
libratis <i>passibus</i> moueretur', and Maximianus (6th century) <i>El</i> III 27
'suspensos ponere <i>gressus</i>'. But the strong manuscript authority for
<i>gestus</i> and the parallels in Ovid mark it as clearly preferable to
<i>gressus</i>.</p>

<p><b>33. PONERE.</b> The verb seems strange, but Burman cited in its support Val
Max VIII vii 7 'Roscius ... nullum umquam spectante populo <i>gestum</i>, nisi
quem domi meditatus fuerat, <i>ponere</i> [<i>codd</i>: promere <i>E. Schulze</i>]
ausus est'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p><b>35-36. LAVDATAQVE VIRTVS / CRESCIT.</b> For this commonplace of ancient
literature see <i>Otto</i> <i>ars</i> 3 and compare <i>RA</i> 393 'nam iuuat et studium
famae mihi creuit honore', <i>Tr</i> V xii 37-38 'denique non paruas animo
dat gloria uires, / et fecunda facit pectora laudis amor', <i>EP</i> III ix
21 'scribentem iuuat ipse fauor minuitque laborem', Prop IV x 3, and Cic
<i>Tusc</i> I 4.</p>

<p><b>36. IMMENSVM GLORIA CALCAR HABET.</b> The same metaphor at <i>Tr</i> V i 75-76
'denique nulla mihi captatur gloria, quaeque / ingeniis <i>stimulos
subdere</i> fama solet', <i>EP</i> I v 57-58 'gloria uos <i>acuat</i>; uos, ut
recitata probentur / carmina, Pieriis inuigilate choris', and Hor <i>Ep</i>
II i 217-18 'uatibus addere <i>calcar</i> / ut studio maiore petant Helicona
uirentem'.</p>

<p><i>Immensum</i> seems rather strange; I have found no good parallel for it.</p>

<p><b>37. HIC MEA CVI RECITEM ... CARMINA.</b> A constant complaint of Ovid in
exile. Compare <i>Tr</i> III xiv 39-40 'nullus in hac terra, recitem si
carmina, cuius / intellecturis auribus utar, adest', <i>Tr</i> IV i 89-90,
and <i>Tr</i> V xii 53 'non liber hic ullus, non qui mihi commodet aurem'.
Perhaps it is significant that Ovid does not complain in the present
passage that he has no books available: certainly he must have had a
substantial library at hand when he composed the <i>Ibis</i>.</p>

<p><b>38. BARBARVS HISTER.</b> The same phrase in the same position (leaving space
for the disyllable) at <i>EP</i> III iii 26 'et coit astrictis <i>barbarus
Hister</i> aquis'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hister</i> was the name of the lower course of the Danube (Pliny <i>NH</i> IV
79). Ovid uses the metrically convenient <i>Hister</i> fifteen times in the
<i>Ex Ponto</i>, as against two instances only of <i>Danuuius</i> (IV ix 80 &amp; x
58).</p>

<p><b>38. OBIT</b> <i>Damst&eacute;</i> HABET <i>codd</i>. In support of <i>obit</i> Damst&eacute; cited x 22
'gentibus obliqua quas <i>obit</i> Hister aqua' (<i>Mnemosyne</i> XLVI 32). As
Professor R. J. Tarrant points out, the only meaning that can be
attached to <i>quasque alias gentes barbarus Hister habet</i> is 'the other
people that live in the Danube'; he compares <i>Her</i> VI 135-36 'prodidit
illa patrem; rapui de clade Thoanta. / deseruit Colchos; me mea Lemnos
habet' and <i>Aen</i> VI 362 (Palinurus speaking) 'nunc me fluctus habet'.
<i>EP</i> III ii 43-44 'nos ... quos procul a uobis Pontus et [<i>uar</i> barbarus]
Hister habet', cited by Lenz in support of <i>habet</i>, is not a good
parallel in view of the different subject (<i>Pontus et Hister</i> instead of
<i>Hister</i> alone).</p>

<p>Lenz cited <i>Tr</i> II 230 'bellaque pro magno Caesare Caesar obit' for a
variant <i>habet</i>; Professor Tarrant cites another instance of the
corruption at <i>Met</i> I 551-52 'pes modo tam uelox pigris radicibus
haeret, / ora cacumen obit'.</p>

<p><b>39. MATERIA</b> = 'means' (<i>OLD materia</i> 8).</p>

<p><b>41. NEC VINVM NEC ME TENET ALEA FALLAX.</b> The same statement at <i>EP</i> I v
45-46 'nec iuuat in lucem nimio marcescere uino, / nec tenet incertas
alea blanda manus'. For Ovid's temperance, compare <i>EP</i> I x 30 'scis
mihi quam solae paene bibantur aquae'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Me tenet</i> in the present passage should perhaps be translated 'holds my
attention' (<i>OLD teneo</i> 22) rather than 'attracts' (Wheeler).</p>

<p><b>41. VINVM.</b> For wine as a diversion from sorrow, compare Tib I ii 1 'Adde
merum uinoque nouos compesce dolores' (with Smith's note) and Tib I v 37
'saepe ego temptaui curas depellere uino'.</p>

<p><b>42. TACITVM TEMPVS.</b> Similar phrases at <i>AA</i> II 670 'iam ueniet <i>tacito</i>
curua senecta pede', <i>Fast</i> VI 771 '<i>tacitis</i> ... senescimus annis', <i>Tr</i>
III vii 35-36 'senectus / quae <i>strepitus passu non faciente</i> uenit',
<i>Tr</i> IV vi 17 '<i>tacito</i> pede lapsa uetustas' and <i>Tr</i> IV x 27 '<i>tacito</i>
passu labentibus annis'.</p>

<p><b>43. QVOD CVPEREM.</b> At <i>EP</i> I viii 39-62 Ovid, having detailed the urban
pleasures he has lost, speaks of his agricultural pursuits in Italy, and
laments that this diversion is not available to him at Tomis. The two
passages add personal meaning to his description at <i>Met</i> XIV 623-34 of
Pomona's gardening and his prescription at <i>RA</i> 169-98 of agriculture as
a diversion from an unhappy love-affair.</p>

<p><b>43. SI PER FERA BELLA LICERET.</b> Compare <i>EP</i> II vii 69-70 'tempus in
agrorum cultu consumere dulce est: / non patitur uerti barbarus hostis
humum' and <i>EP</i> III viii 6 'hostis ab agricola uix sinit illa [<i>sc</i>
loca] fodi'. At <i>Tr</i> III x 57-66 Ovid gives a vivid description of what
could happen to the farmers of Tomis in a raid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p><b>44. NOVATA</b> = 'restored to fertility through ploughing'. Ovid more
commonly uses <i>renouare</i>, as at <i>Tr</i> V xii 23-24 'fertilis, assiduo si
non renouetur aratro, / nil nisi cum spinis gramen habebit ager', <i>Am</i> I
iii 9, <i>Met</i> I 110 &amp; XV 125, <i>Fast</i> I 159, and <i>Tr</i> IV vi 13.</p>

<p><b>45. RESTANT</b> is not strictly logical, but a similar attraction of number
is confirmed by metre at <i>Tr</i> I ii 1 'Di maris et caeli&mdash;quid enim nisi
uota <i>supersunt</i>?'; RESTAT (<i>IP</i>) must therefore be rejected.</p>

<p>Similar confusions occur in the manuscripts at <i>Met</i> XIV 396 'nec
quicquam antiqui [<i>Berolinensis Heinsii</i>: antiquum <i>codd plerique</i>] Pico
nisi nomina <i>restant</i>' and <i>Tr</i> IV x 85 'si tamen extinctis aliquid nisi
nomina <i>restant</i>'.</p>

<p><b>47. TV, CVI BIBITVR FELICIVS AONIVS FONS.</b> For the image of the poet
drinking from Hippocrene see Prop III iii 5-6 'paruaque tam magnis
admoram fontibus ora, / unde pater sitiens Ennius ante bibit'. Both here
and at II x 25 Propertius speaks of Hippocrene as the spring of epic
poetry specifically.</p>

<p><b>47. FELICIVS.</b> 'With happier result'; compare <i>Ibis</i> 559 'nec tibi, si
quid amas, felicius Haemone [=<i>quam Haemoni</i>] cedat'.</p>

<p><b>47. AONIVS FONS.</b> Platnauer (13) cites only four instances from the
elegiac poets of hexameters ending in monosyllables: Prop II xxv 17
'amor, qui', <i>Am</i> II ix 47 'Cupido, est', the present passage, and <i>EP</i>
IV ix 101 'quibus nos'. Ehwald and Levy compare <i>Met</i> V 573 'quae tibi
causa fugae, cur sis, Arethusa, sacer <i>fons</i>'. The coincidence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> suggests
that in both passages Ovid was recalling a line-ending from an earlier
poet. Alternatively, Professor E. Fantham suggests to me that Ovid may
here have deliberately created an awkward line-ending so as to mock
himself and bear out his claim of waning inspiration.</p>

<p><b>47-50.</b> Ovid returns to the subject of his poem's opening, Severus'
poetry.</p>

<p><b>48. VTILITER ... CEDIT.</b> Similar phrasing at <i>EP</i> II vii 19 '[iam liquet

<p><b>49. MERITO.</b> 'With justification'; Severus' previous service to the Muses
has brought him fame and not, as in Ovid's case, disaster.</p>

<p><b>50. HVC ALIQVOD CVRAE MITTE RECENTIS OPVS.</b> A similar request at <i>EP</i> III

<h2><a name="III_To_An_Unfaithful_Friend" id="III_To_An_Unfaithful_Friend"></a>III. To An Unfaithful Friend</h2>


<p>By the time Ovid wrote this poem, the letter of reproach was a genre
familiar to him: each book of the <i>Tristia</i> (with the obvious exception
of II) contains such a poem (I viii; III xi; IV ix; V viii), and in the
<i>Ibis</i> Ovid had, by the extended treatment of a number of standard
topics within the subject, created a poem of over six hundred lines.</p>

<p>Ovid begins the poem by stating that he has heard about his friend's
faithlessness; he asks what possible excuse there might be for this
behaviour (1-28). He then warns his friend that Fortune is changeable,
and gives four examples of famous men who fell from prosperity (29-48).
He ends the poem by stating once again that Fortune is undependable, and
gives his own catastrophe as an instance; his friend should remember
this, and moderate his behaviour accordingly (49-58).</p>

<p>The poem has points of contact with the earlier poems of reproach. <i>Tr</i>
I viii is addressed to a friend who failed to visit Ovid after his
disaster: he can scarcely believe his friend is human. In <i>Tr</i> III xi,
Ovid asks his enemy why through his actions he makes his punishment even
worse. <i>Tr</i> IV ix is a warning that if Ovid's enemy does not cease
attacking him, he will through his poetry make his enemy's name infamous
throughout the world. <i>Tr</i> V viii, the poem closest in theme to the
present one, is a warning to his enemy that Fortune is changeable and
Augustus merciful, so he and Ovid might one day change situations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Ibis</i>, being primarily a catalogue of literary curses, stands
somewhat apart from the other poems of reproach in structure as in size;
yet the opening of the poem, in which Ovid describes his enemy's conduct
and the ways he might respond, offers a number of parallels to the
present poem.</p>

<p><b>1. CONQVERAR AN TACEAM.</b> Kenney (<i>Nequitiae Poeta</i> 204-5), commenting on
<i>AA</i> I 739 'conquerar an moneam', cites other instances of the same
rhetorical device at <i>Aen</i> III 39 ' eloquar an sileam?' and <i>Met</i> IX 147
'conquerar an sileam?', as well as the present passage.</p>

<p><b>1. CONQVERAR.</b> The choice of verb is significant: this poem is a
rhetorical <i>conquestio</i> transferred to verse. Kenney cites Cicero's
definition of <i>conquestio</i> at <i>Inu</i> I 106: 'conquestio est oratio
auditorum misericordiam captans ... id locis communibus efficere
oportebit, per quos Fortunae uis in omnes et hominum infirmitas
ostenditur; qua oratione ... animus hominum ... ad misericordiam
comparatur, cum in alieno malo suam infirmitatem considerabit'.</p>

<p><b>1. PONAM SINE NOMINE CRIMEN.</b> 'Shall I put my accusation in my poem
without naming you?'. The same sense of <i>ponere</i> at <i>Tr</i> I v 7
'<i>positis</i> pro nomine signis', <i>Tr</i> IV iv 7, and <i>EP</i> III vi 1-2 'Naso
suo (<i>posuit</i> nomen quam paene!) sodali / mittit ab Euxinis hoc breue
carmen aquis'.</p>

<p><b>2. QVI SIS.</b> The boundary between adjectival <i>qui</i> and pronominal <i>quis</i>
in Latin was not absolute; and just as one finds such forms as <i>quis
clamor</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> (<i>Met</i> III 632), so it seems to have been Latin practice to use
<i>qui</i> before forms of <i>esse</i> in indirect discourse, perhaps in order to
avoid a double <i>s</i>-sound. Some instances of this from verse are <i>Ecl</i> I
18 'iste deus <i>qui sit</i> da, Tityre, nobis', <i>Ecl</i> II 19 'nec <i>qui sim</i>
quaeris, Alexi', <i>Aen</i> III 608-9 '<i>qui sit</i> fari ... hortamur', <i>Met</i> XIV
841 'mihi nec <i>quae sis</i> dicere promptum est', <i>Met</i> XV 595 'is <i>qui
sit</i> signo, non nomine dicam', <i>Fast</i> V 191 'ipse doce <i>quae sis</i>',
<i>Ibis</i> 52 'teque breui <i>qui sis</i> dissimulare sinam', <i>Ibis</i> 61 '<i>qui
sis</i> nondum quaerentibus edo', and <i>EP</i> III vi 57 'teque tegam, <i>qui
sis</i>'. In some of these passages <i>quis</i> is found as a variant reading;
given the ease of corruption, the rule should perhaps be made canonical,
and such passages as <i>Met</i> I 248-49 '<i>quis sit</i> laturus in aras / tura'
supplied with forms of <i>qui</i> even when, as in this instance, there is
only weak manuscript support. (Professor R. J. Tarrant prefers, however,
to retain <i>quis</i> at <i>Met</i> I 248, seeing a difference between expressions
of identity [<i>qui sis ... dicam</i>] and of description [<i>sit</i> and <i>laturus</i>
go closely together]).</p>

<p>The use of <i>qui</i> seems to have extended to past subjunctives of <i>esse</i>
as well as present: compare <i>Met</i> XI 719 'qui [<i>uar</i> quis] foret
ignorans'. For discussions see L&ouml;fstedt II 79-96 and Shackleton Bailey
on <i>Att</i> III x 2 'possum obliuisci <i>qui fuerim</i>, non sentire qui sim?'.</p>

<p>In preclassical Latin <i>qui</i> is found for <i>quis</i> even in direct
questions: <i>OLD qui</i> A4a cites Pl <i>Capt</i> 833 'qui uocat', Ter <i>Ph</i> 990
'qui nominat me', and Scipio minor V 19 Malcovati<sup>3</sup> 'qui spondet mille
nummum'. The usage must have continued in spoken Latin, for it is found
at Vitruvius VII 5 6 and Petronius 62 8.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p><b>3. NOMINE NON VTAR, NE COMMENDERE QVERELA.</b> An interesting indication of
the confidence Ovid felt in his poetry. In his earlier poems of
reproach, Ovid had represented his not naming the person as an act of
forbearance (<i>Tr</i> IV ix 1-4; <i>Ibis</i> 51-54).</p>

<p><b>3. COMMENDERE QVERELA.</b> Oxymoron.</p>

<p><b>5. DVM MEA PVPPIS ERAT VALIDA FVNDATA CARINA.</b> The common ancient
metaphor of shipwreck also used of Ovid's exile at <i>Tr</i> I i 85-86, <i>Tr</i>
II 99-102, <i>Tr</i> III iv 15-16 'dum tecum uixi, dum me leuis aura ferebat,
/ haec mea per placidas cumba cucurrit aquas', <i>Tr</i> V xii 50, and <i>EP</i>
II iii 25-28.</p>

<p><b>7. CONTRAXIT VVLTVM.</b> See at i 5 <i>trahis uultus</i> (<a href="#Page_149">p 149</a>).</p>

<p><b>9-10</b> form a tricolon, where each phrase represents the same action in
progressively more specific terms: (1) 'dissimulas etiam' (2) 'nec me
uis nosse uideri' (3) 'quisque sit audito nomine Naso rogas'.</p>

<p><b>9. DISSIMVLAS.</b> The same word in similar contexts at <i>Tr</i> I i 62
'dissimulare uelis, te liquet esse meum', <i>Tr</i> III vi 2, <i>Tr</i> IV iii 54,
<i>Tr</i> IV iv 28, and <i>EP</i> I ii 146.</p>

<p><b>9. NEC ME VIS NOSSE VIDERI.</b> 'You don't want others to think you know
me'. Similar thought and language at <i>Tr</i> IV iii 51 'me miserum si turpe
putas mihi nupta uideri!' and <i>EP</i> II iii 29-30 'cumque alii <i>nolint</i>
etiam <i>me nosse uideri</i>, / uix duo proiecto tresue tulistis opem'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p><b>10. QVISQVE SIT. QVIQVE SIT</b> (<i>H<sup>ac</sup>P</i>) could be defended, <i>sit</i>
determining the form <i>qui</i>, even with the intervening enclitic, but
given the prevalence of relative <i>quique</i> at line-beginnings in Ovid
(compare xvi 9, 11, 15, 19 &amp; 23) it seems better to take it as a trivial
error.</p>

<p><b>11, 13, 15, 17. ILLE EGO.</b> The same idiom to stir someone's memory at
<i>Fast</i> III 505-6 '<i>illa ego sum</i> cui tu solitus promittere caelum: / ei
mihi, pro caelo qualia dona fero' and <i>EP</i> I ii 129-32 '<i>ille ego sum</i>
qui te colui, quem festa solebat / inter conuiuas mensa uidere tuos: /
<i>ille ego qui</i> duxi uestros Hymenaeon ad ignes, / et cecini fausto
carmina digna toro'. R. G. Austin, discussing the spurious proem to the
<i>Aeneid</i> (<i>CQ</i> LX, n.s. XVIII [1968] 110-11), cites <i>Tr</i> V vii 55-56
'<i>ille ego</i> Romanus uates&mdash;ignoscite, Musae!&mdash; / Sarmatico cogor plurima
more loqui', <i>Met</i> I 757-58 '<i>ille ego</i> liber, / ille ferox tacui',
Statius <i>Sil</i> V v 38 &amp; <i>Theb</i> IX 434, and Silius XI 177-82: 'It will be
noticed ... that all these examples represent the new situation as a fall
from grace'.</p>

<p><b>12. AMICITIA.</b> Ovid allows pentasyllabic words to end the pentameter only
in the poetry of exile (Platnauer 17). There are eight such words in the
<i>Tristia</i>, and four in the <i>Ex Ponto</i>: I ii 68 <i>patrocinium</i>, II ix 20
<i>Ericthonius</i>, this passage, and xiii 44 <i>amicitiae</i> (Platnauer 17;
Riese vii). This distribution contrasts with Ovid's increasing fondness
in the <i>Ex Ponto</i> for trisyllabic and quadrisyllabic endings, for which
see at ix 26 <i>tegeret</i> and ii 10 <i>Alcinoo</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>The later <i>Heroides</i> have two pentasyllabic pentameter-endings, XVI 290
<i>pudicitiae</i> and XVII 16 <i>superciliis</i>.</p>

<p><b>13-14. ILLE EGO QVI PRIMVS TVA SERIA NOSSE SOLEBAM, / ET TIBI IVCVNDIS
PRIMVS ADESSE IOCIS.</b> The same joining of <i>seria</i> and <i>ioci</i> (or <i>lusus</i>)
at <i>Tr</i> I viii 31-32, <i>EP</i> I ix 9-10, <i>EP</i> II iv 9-10 '<i>seria</i> multa
mihi tecum conlata recordor, / nec data <i>iucundis</i> tempora pauca
<i>iocis</i>', and <i>EP</i> II x 41-42. It is found in prose and early Latin:
Luck at <i>Tr</i> I viii 31-32 cites Cic <i>Fin</i> II 85 'at quicum <i>ioca, seria,
ut dicitur</i>, quicum arcana, quicum occulta omnia? tecum, optime', Pliny
<i>Ep</i> II xiii 5 'cum hoc <i>seria</i>, cum hoc <i>iocos</i> miscui', Pliny <i>Ep</i> IV
xvii 5 'nihil a me ille secretum, non <i>ioculare</i>, non <i>serium</i>, non
triste, non laetum', and Ennius <i>Ann</i> 239-40 Vahlen<sup>3</sup> 'cui res audacter
magnas paruasque iocumque / eloqueretur'.</p>

<p><b>15. CONVICTOR.</b> The word belongs properly to prose, the only other
occurrences in verse being two passages in Horace's <i>Satires</i>: I iv 96
'me ... <i>conuictore</i> usus amicoque' &amp; I vi 47 'quia sim tibi, Maecenas,
<i>conuictor</i>'. <i>Conuictus</i> is similarly found in verse twice only, in
Ovid's poetry of exile (<i>Tr</i> I viii 29-30 '<i>conuictu</i> causisque
ualentibus ... temporis et longi iunctus amore tibi' &amp; <i>EP</i> II x 9-10
'quam [<i>sc</i> curam] tu uel longi debes <i>conuictibus</i> aeui, / uel mea quod
coniunx non aliena tibi est').</p>

<p><b>15. DENSOQVE.</b> 'Frequent, often recurring'. This sense of <i>densus</i> is not
found elsewhere in Ovid, but compare Virgil <i>G</i> IV 347 '<i>densos</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> diuum
numerabat amores', Statius <i>Theb</i> VI 421, and Juvenal IX 35-37 'quamuis
... blandae assidue <i>densaeque</i> tabellae / sollicitent'. The closest
parallel for the poetic singular cited by <i>OLD densus</i> 3a is Martial IX
lxxxvii 1-2 'Septem post calices Opimiani / <i>denso</i> cum iaceam
triente<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> blaesus'.</p>

<p><b>15. DOMESTICVS.</b> Apparently the only instance of the substantive in
verse. The word is common enough in prose, and formed part of the spoken
language, for it is found in reported speech at Petronius 45 6.</p>

<p><b>17. QVEM</b> <i>Leidensis Heinsii</i> QVI <i>codd plerique</i>. <i>Qui</i> cannot be
connected with <i>nescis</i>, and so is without antecedent. The scribe was
probably influenced by 11, 13, and 15, in which <i>ille ego</i> is completed
by a nominative clause.</p>

<p>For <i>quem ... an uiuam</i> compare <i>EP</i> III vi 57 '<i>te</i>que tegam, <i>qui
sis</i>'.</p>

<p><b>17. VIVAM.</b> Heinsius' VIVAT is unnecessary: the assimilation of person
seems reasonable enough in view of such passages as <i>EP</i> I ii 129-31
'ille ego sum qui te <i>colui</i> ... ille ego qui <i>duxi</i> uestros Hymenaeon ad
ignes'.</p>

<p><b>18. SVBIT</b> <i>Heinsius</i> FVIT <i>codd</i>. The preceding <i>nescis</i> requires a verb
with present meaning; and <i>fuit</i> seems impossible to construe as a true<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
perfect (with present result). Heinsius' <i>subit</i> seems an elegant
solution: certain manuscripts offer the same corruption of <i>subit</i> to
<i>fuit</i> at <i>Met</i> IX 93-94 'lux <i>subit</i>, et primo feriente cacumina sole /
discedunt iuuenes' and <i>Met</i> XIV 827-28 'pulchra <i>subit</i> facies et
puluinaribus altis / dignior'.</p>

<p><b>19-20. SIVE FVI NVMQVAM CARVS, SIMVLASSE FATERIS; / SEV NON FINGEBAS,
INVENIERE LEVIS.</b> For a similar opposition (either alternative being
discreditable), see <i>Met</i> IX 23-24 'nam, quo te iactas, Alcmena nate,
creatum, / Iuppiter aut falsus pater est aut crimine uerus'.</p>

<p><b>21. AVT.</b> 'Otherwise'. For the use of <i>aut</i> as a disjunctive adverb
rather than a conjunction compare xii 3 'aut ego non alium prius hoc
dignarer honore' and the passages there cited. Here, as at xii 3, the
idiom has been misunderstood by scribes, with such resulting variants in
late manuscripts as EIA ('uterque Medonii pro diuersa lectione';
accepted by Heinsius) and DIC (<i>Gothanus II 121</i>; printed by Burman).</p>

<p><b>21. IRAM.</b> 'Cause for anger'. This seems to be the only instance of the
meaning, <i>ira</i> not being found even as a predicative dative; but compare
the use of <i>laudes</i> to mean 'acts deserving praise', as at viii 87 'tuas
... laudes ... recentes'.</p>

<p><b>23. QVOD TE NVNC CRIMEN SIMILEM</b> seems to be the correct reading; the
line connects with the <i>an crimen ...</i> of 24. QVAE TE CONSIMILEM RES
NVNC (<i>FIL</i>) looks like a rewriting of the line, perhaps following the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
loss of <i>crimen</i> by haplography (<i>cr</i>i&#109;&#773; <i>s</i>im<i>il&#275;</i>). There seems
no good reason why Ovid would have used the emphatic <i>consimilem</i>
instead of the more usual <i>similem</i>.</p>

<p><b>25. SI ... OPEM NVLLAM ... FEREBAS.</b> 'If you had no intention of assisting
me'&mdash;the inceptive or conative imperfect (Woodcock 200). Similar
phrasing at <i>Tr</i> I viii 9-10 'haec ego uaticinor, quia sum deceptus ab
illo / <i>laturum</i> misero quem mihi rebar <i>opem</i>' and <i>EP</i> II vii 46 'et
nihil inueni quod mihi <i>ferret opem</i>'.</p>

<p><b>25. REBVS ... FACTISQVE.</b> 'Through financial help or action on my behalf'.
Ovid does not use this sense of <i>res</i> elsewhere in his poetry.</p>

<p><b>26. VERBIS ... TRIBVS.</b> 'A few words'. For the idiom Williams cites
Plautus <i>Mil</i> 1020 '"breuin an longinquo sermoni?" "tribu' uerbis"' and
<i>Trin</i> 963 'adgrediundust hic homo mi astu.&mdash;heus, Pax, te tribu' uerbis
uolo'; from comedy, <i>OLD tres</i> b cites Ter <i>Ph</i> 638. From the classical
period compare Sen <i>Apocol</i> 11 3 'ad summam, tria uerba cito dicat, et
seruum me ducat', Sen <i>Ep</i> 40 9, and Quint IX iv 84 'haec omnia in
tribus uerbis'; Camps sees <i>tres</i> as having the same indefinite meaning
at Prop II xiii 25-26 'sat mea sit magno [<i>Phillimore</i>: sit magna <i>uel</i>
sat magna est <i>codd</i>] si tres sint pompa libelli / quos ego Persephonae
maxima dona feram'.</p>

<p><b>27. SED ET</b> was the standard reading until Ehwald's defence (<i>KB</i> 63) of
SVBITO, the reading of (<i>B<sup>1</sup></i>) and <i>C</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Ehwald's reasoning was that <i>sed et</i> would indicate that the news of his
friend's slandering him was additional information, and that Ovid
already knew something of his friend's behaviour. But this is precisely
the case: Ovid has just finished saying that his friend has done nothing
to help him (9-10), and now he gives the additional information that his
friend is even working against him. Ehwald supported the asyndeton that
<i>subito</i> creates by quoting <i>Met</i> XV 359-60 'haud equidem credo: sparsae
quoque membra uenenis / exercere artes Scythides memorantur easdem',
where in fact <i>quoque</i> seems a convincing parallel to <i>sed et</i>.</p>

<p><b>27. INSVLTARE IACENTI.</b> 'Torment in my misery'. Ovid plays on the literal
meanings of <i>iacere</i> and <i>in-saltare</i>; for the latter, see <i>Aen</i> XII
338-39 'caesis / hostibus insultans'. Ovid uses <i>insultare</i> in only
three other passages. All are from the poems of exile, and all are about
the ill-treatment accorded Ovid: <i>Tr</i> II 571 'nec mihi credibile est
quemquam <i>insultasse iacenti</i>', <i>Tr</i> III xi 1, and <i>Tr</i> V viii 3-4
'curue / casibus insultas quos potes ipse pati?'.</p>

<p><b>29. A DEMENS.</b> <i>A</i> indicates a certain amount of sympathy with the person
addressed, as can be seen from <i>Tr</i> V x 51-52 'quid loquor, <i>a demens</i>?
ipsam quoque perdere uitam, / Caesaris offenso numine, dignus eram' and
<i>Ecl</i> II 60-61 'quem fugis, <i>a demens</i>? habitarunt di quoque siluas /
Dardaniusque Paris'. <i>O</i> (<i>M<sup>1</sup>FILT</i>) would indicate rather less sympathy:
compare <i>Met</i> III 640-41 'dextera Naxos erat: dextra mihi lintea danti /
"quid facis, <i>o demens</i>? quis te furor" inquit "Acoete?"'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p><b>29. RECEDAT</b> (<i>TM<sup>2</sup></i>) is no doubt a scribal conjecture, but a correct one:
'Why, in case disaster should strike ...'. Most manuscripts have
RECEDIT.</p>

<p><b>31. ORBE</b> probably means 'wheel'; compare Tib I v 70 'uersatur celeri
Fors leuis orbe <i>rotae</i>' and <i>Cons ad Liuiam</i> 51-52 (quoted in the next
note). However, Professor E. Fantham points out to me that it could also
mean 'sphere': she cites Pacuvius 366-67 Ribbeck<sup>2</sup> (<i>Rhet Her</i> II 36)
'Fortunam insanam esse et caecam et brutam perhibent philosophi, /
<i>saxoque</i> instare in <i>globoso</i> praedicant <i>uolubilei</i>'. Smith at Tib I v
70 gives numerous instances of both images.</p>

<p><b>32. QVEM</b>, found in Heinsius' <i>fragmentum Boxhornianum</i> (=Leid. Bibl.
Publ. 180 G), must be right as against the QVAE of the other
manuscripts; if a definition is to be given after the preceding 'haec
dea non stabili quam sit leuis orbe fatetur', it should be a definition
of the wheel, not the goddess. But the resulting <i>quem summum dubio</i>
seems very awkwardly phrased, and further emendation is probably needed.</p>

<p>The obvious solution would be to read 'quem summo [<i>C</i> in fact reads
<i>summo</i>] <i>dubium</i> sub pede semper habet'. This would give <i>orbis</i> a
standard epithet, as at <i>Tr</i> V viii 7-8 'nec metuis <i>dubio</i> Fortunae
stantis in <i>orbe</i> / numen' and <i>Cons ad Liuiam</i> 51-52 'nempe per hos
etiam Fortunae iniuria mores / regnat et <i>incerta</i> est hic quoque nixa
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span><i>rota</i>'. In support of the rather more difficult <i>summo ... pede</i>
(='toes') Professor R. J. Tarrant cites Sen <i>Suas</i> II 17 'insistens
<i>summis digitis</i> ['toes']&mdash;sic enim solebat quo grandior fieret', Sen
<i>Tro</i> 1090-91 'in cacumine / erecta <i>summos</i> [<i>uar</i> summo] turba
librauit <i>pedes</i>', and <i>Met</i> IV 562 'aequora destringunt <i>summis</i>
Ismenides <i>alis</i>'; compare as well <i>Met</i> IX 342-43 'in adludentibus
undis / <i>summa pedum</i> taloque tenus uestigia tingit'.</p>

<p>A second solution might be to read 'quem <i>dubio summum</i> sub pede semper
habet'; the transfer of <i>dubius</i> from <i>orbis</i> to <i>pes</i> seems acceptable
enough, and <i>Met</i> IV 134-36 'oraque buxo / pallidiora gerens exhorruit
aequoris instar, / quod tremit exigua cum summum stringitur aura' offers
a good parallel to <i>summum</i>.</p>

<p>The image of Fortune standing on her wheel occurs elsewhere in Ovid's
poems of exile at <i>Tr</i> V viii 7-8 (quoted above) and <i>EP</i> II iii 55-56
'scilicet indignum, iuuenis carissime, ducis / te fieri comitem stantis
in orbe deae'.</p>

<p><b>33. QVOLIBET EST FOLIO ... INCERTIOR.</b> For the proverb, see Otto <i>folium</i>
1; and from Ovid compare <i>Am</i> II xvi 45-46 'uerba puellarum, foliis
leuiora caducis, / inrita qua uisum est uentus et unda ferunt', <i>Her</i> V
109-10 'tu leuior foliis tum cum sine pondere suci / mobilibus uentis
arida facta uolant', and <i>Fast</i> III 481-82 (Ariadne speaking) 'Bacche
leuis leuiorque tuis quae tempora cingunt / frondibus'.</p>

<p><b>33. QVAVIS INCERTIOR AVRA.</b> Compare <i>Her</i> VI 109-10 'mobilis Aesonide
uernaque incertior aura, / cur tua polliciti pondere uerba carent?'.
Otto (<i>uentus</i> 1) cites as well Prop II v 11-13 'non ita Carpathiae<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
uariant Aquilonibus undae, / nec dubio nubes uertitur atra Noto, / quam

Hero) 'cumque minus firmum nil sit quam uentus et unda, / in uentis et

uentis o femina!'.</p>

<p>The <i>folium</i> and <i>uentus</i> images of the present line are found together
at Prop II ix 33-35 'non sic incerto mutantur flamine Syrtes, / nec
folia hiberno tam tremefacta Noto, / quam cito feminea non constat
foedus in ira'.</p>

<p><b>34. PAR ILLI</b> = <i>par illius leuitati</i>. Similar compressions at vi 40
'mollior est animo femina nulla tuo' and commonly.</p>

<p><b>37-38.</b> Ovid gives four instances of unexpected catastrophe, two from
Greek history, two from Roman; the greater importance of the Roman
examples is emphasized by their position and by the doubling of the
space allotted to each example from two lines to four. There is a
similar transition at Prop II vi 19-20 'cur exempla petam Graium? tu
criminis auctor / nutritus duro, Romule, lacte lupae'.</p>

<p>The Greek examples may have been a traditional pairing: Croesus and
Dionysius are mentioned together at Lucian <i>Gall</i> 23 as notable
instances of personal catastrophe.</p>

<p><b>37. OPVLENTIA CROESI.</b> Croesus as the archetype of wealth also at <i>Tr</i>
III vii 41-42 'nempe dat ... Fortuna rapitque, / Irus et est subito qui
modo Croesus erat'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>The story of Croesus' downfall and the subsequent sparing of his life by
Cyrus is taken from Herodotus I 86-88.</p>

<p>It is clear from his poetry that Ovid had a good knowledge of at least
the first book of Herodotus:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Met</i> III 135-37 'sed scilicet ultima semper / expectanda dies
homini est, dicique beatus / ante obitum nemo supremaque funera debet'
may have been drawn from Solon's advice to Croesus at Herodotus I 32 7:
'&#949;&#7984; &#948;&#8050; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#963;&#953;
[if in addition to having prosperity while alive]

<p>(2) At <i>Fast</i> II 79-118 Ovid tells the story of Arion found at Herodotus
I 23-24.</p>

<p>(3) At <i>Fast</i> II 663-66 there occurs the clearest instance of borrowing:
Ovid uses the story of the border dispute between Sparta and Argos
(Herodotus I 82) in the course of his discussion of the god Terminus:
'si tu signasses olim Thyreatida terram, / corpora non leto missa
trecenta forent, / nec foret Othryades congestis lectus [<i>Barth</i>: tectus
<i>codd</i>] in armis. / o quantum patriae sanguinis ille dedit!'.</p>

<p><b>37. AVDITA EST CVI NON.</b> Compare <i>Met</i> XV 319-20 '<i>cui non audita est</i>
obscenae Salmacis undae / Aethiopesque lacus?'.</p>

<p><b>38. NEMPE TAMEN VITAM CAPTVS AB HOSTE TVLIT.</b> 'Even so, it is undeniable
that he became a prisoner, and received his life as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> gift from his
enemy'. <i>Vitam ferre</i> also at <i>EP</i> II i 45 (from a description of
Germanicus' triumph of AD 12) 'maxima pars horum <i>uitam</i> ueniamque
<i>tulerunt</i>'.</p>

<p><b>39. ILLE ... FORMIDATVS.</b> Equivalent to <i>ille</i> with a defining
<i>qui</i>-clause: 'The famous man who had once been feared ...'. Ovid is
referring to Dionysius II, the student of Plato, who was expelled from
Syracuse in 344 and became a schoolmaster in Corinth. Valerius Maximus
(VI ix ext 6) also gives Dionysius as an example of unexpected disaster,
and Plutarch (<i>Timoleon</i> 14) cites him as an example of the operations
of Fortune. For an account of Dionysius' life at Corinth, see Justinus
XXI v. There was a Greek proverb '&#916;&#953;&#959;&#957;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#922;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#957;&#952;&#8179;'
(Cic <i>Att</i> IX ix 1; Quintilian VIII vi 52), apparently referring to his
continued lust for power: 'Dionysius ... Syracusis expulsus Corinthi
pueros docebat: usque eo imperio carere non poterat' (Cic <i>Tusc</i> III
27). Discussions of the proverb at Otto <i>Dionysius</i> and Shackleton
Bailey on <i>Att</i> IX ix 1.</p>

<p><b>39. SYRACOSIA ... IN VRBE.</b> Restored by Heinsius from the manuscripts'
unmetrical SYRACVSIA, as at <i>Fast</i> VI 277. The same confusion between
&#931;&#965;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#972;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962;
and &#931;&#965;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962;
is found in the manuscripts
of Pindar (<i>Ol</i> I 23), the Attic form supplanting the original Doric.
The same corruption is found in some ninth-century manuscripts of Virgil
at <i>Ecl</i> VI 1 'Prima Syracosio dignata est ludere uersu' and in the
Veronese scholia, and in the manuscripts of Claudian <i>carm min</i> LI 6
(Housman 1273).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p><b>40. HVMILI ... ARTE.</b> For the low social position of the schoolmaster in
antiquity, see Bonner 146-62, and compare especially Juvenal VII 197-98
'si Fortuna uolet, fies de rhetore consul; / si uolet haec eadem, fiet
de consule rhetor' and Pliny <i>Ep</i> IV xi 1 'nunc eo decidit ut exul de
senatore, rhetor de oratore fieret'.</p>

<p><b>41. MAGNO MAIVS.</b> 'Greater than (Pompey) the Great'. Even in the letters
of Cicero, Pompey is occasionally called <i>Magnus</i> without further
identification (<i>Att</i> I xvi 12). Other plays on the name at <i>Fast</i> I
603-4 'Magne, tuum nomen rerum est mensura tuarum; / sed qui te uicit
nomine maior erat' and Lucan I 135 'stat magni nominis umbra', where
Getty cites Velleius II 1 4 'Pompeium magni nominis uirum'.</p>

<p><b>42. CLIENTIS OPEM.</b> After the final defeat at Pharsalus, Pompey fled to
Egypt and sought the protection of Ptolemy XIII (Caesar <i>BC</i> III 103,
Plutarch <i>Pomp</i> 77).</p>

<p>Pompey similarly treated as the victim of Fortune at Cic <i>Tusc</i> I 86 and
through much of Lucan VII-VIII; compare as well <i>Anth Lat</i> Riese 401
'Quam late uestros duxit Fortuna triumphos, / tam late sparsit funera,
Magne, tua'.</p>

<p>Compare as well <i>Anth Lat</i> 415 39-40 'spes Magnum profugum toto
discurrere in orbe / iusserat et pueri regis adire pedes'; the distich
follows a description of the hardships undergone by Marius.</p>

<p><b>44.</b> The line is omitted by <i>B<sup>1</sup></i> and <i>C</i>; other manuscripts offer (with
minor variations) INDIGVS EFFECTVS OMNIBVS IPSE MAGIS or ACHILLAS<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
PHARIVS ABSTVLIT ENSE CAPVT, a line apparently devised with the aid of
Juvenal X 285-86 'Fortuna ... uicto <i>caput abstulit</i>' and Lucan VIII
545-46 'ullusne in cladibus istis / est locus Aegypto <i>Phariusque</i>
admittitur <i>ensis</i>?', both passages concerned with Pompey's murder by
Achillas. Clearly a line of the poem was lost in transmission.</p>

<p>Heinsius and Bentley felt that the entire distich should be deleted; but
43 seems acceptable enough, and it is appropriate that the description
of Pompey's downfall be balanced with the four-line mention of Marius
that follows. It would be strange if Pompey's sensational murder were
overlooked, as this was regarded by the poets as the ultimate reversal
of his fortunes: compare Manilius IV 50-55, Juvenal X 283-86 (which is
joined to a mention of Marius' reversal) and <i>Anth Lat</i> 401-3 Riese.</p>

<p><b>45. ILLE</b> goes with Marius two lines on&mdash;'the famous Marius'.</p>

<p><b>45. IVGVRTHINO ... CIMBROQVE TRIVMPHO.</b> Marius rose to prominence in the
Jugurthine war, celebrating his triumph in 104; in 101 his defeat in the
Po valley of the Cimbri, a Germanic tribe originally from Jutland, ended
a twelve-year military threat to Rome.</p>

<p><b>47. IN CAENO LATVIT MARIVS.</b> In 88 Sulla, whose command against
Mithridates had been transferred to Marius by a special law, marched on
Rome and induced the Senate to name Marius an outlaw; Marius was forced
to escape to Africa, at one point on the route hiding in the marshes of
Minturnae. This ordeal is mentioned by the poets who deal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> with Marius,
but they consider that he reached the low point of his fortunes when he
arrived at Carthage. Compare Manilius IV 47-49, Juvenal X 276-77
'exilium et carcer Minturnarumque paludes / et mendicatus uicta
Carthagine panis' and <i>Anth Lat</i> 415 33-38 Riese.</p>

<p><b>47. LATVIT MARIVS</b> <i>M</i> IACVIT MARIVS <i>H</i> MARIVS LATVIT <i>L</i> MARIVS IACVIT
<i>BCFIT</i>. <i>Iacere</i> and <i>latere</i> could each be corrupted to the other with
ease: such corruptions occur in certain manuscripts at <i>Met</i> I 338 and
<i>Fast</i> II 244 (<i>iacere</i> corrupted to <i>latere</i>) and <i>Fast</i> II 467, II 587
&amp; III 265 (<i>latere</i> corrupted to <i>iacere</i>). Although it is weakly
attested, <i>latuit</i> should be read here in view of the use of <i>abdere</i> at
Velleius II xix 2 'paludem Maricae, in quam se fugiens consectantis
Sullae equites <i>abdiderat</i>' and Lucan II 70 'exul limosa Marius caput
<i>abdidit</i> ulua', and of
&#954;&#961;&#973;&#960;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957;
at Plutarch <i>Marius</i> 37 5:
<i>latere</i> is often virtually a passive form of <i>abdere</i>.</p>

<p><i>Marius latuit</i> looks like a normalization of word order from the
emphatic <i>latuit Marius</i>.</p>

<p><b>47. CANNAQVE PALVSTRI.</b> <i>Canna palustris</i> is a standard feature of Ovid's
marshes; see <i>AA</i> I 554, <i>RA</i> 142, and <i>Met</i> IV 298 &amp; VIII 337. At <i>RA</i>
142 Henderson comments 'Ovid probably means the plant called in this
country [Scotland] Reed (<i>Phragmites communis</i>, a grass), which the
Italians call <i>canna di palude</i>; smaller than <i>harundo</i> (<i>Arundo donax</i>,
the Greek &#954;&#940;&#957;&#957;&#945; and Italian canna), it nevertheless often
reaches a height of 6 or 7 feet'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p><b>48. MVLTA PVDENDA.</b> The entire sequence of events during Marius' flight
to Africa.</p>

<p><b>50. FACIT</b> <i>R. J. Tarrant</i>. For <i>fidem facere</i> ('induce belief') compare
<i>Met</i> VI 565-66 'dat gemitus fictos commentaque funera narrat, / et
lacrimae <i>fecere fidem</i>' and Caesar <i>BC</i> II 37 1 'nuntiabantur haec
eadem Curioni, sed aliquamdiu <i>fides fieri</i> non poterat: tantam habebat
suarum rerum fiduciam'. Ehwald (<i>KB</i> 63) defends FERET (<i>BC</i>), quoting
<i>Aen</i> X 792 'si qua <i>fidem</i> tanto est operi <i>latura</i> uetustas', but the
true meaning of this line is 'if antiquity can ever win belief for a
deed so grand' (Jackson Knight); the idiom cannot be fitted into the
present passage with acceptable meaning. HABET, the reading of most
manuscripts, does not account for FERET, but is in itself acceptable
enough; compare <i>Her</i> XVI 59-60 'ecce pedum pulsu uisa est mihi terra
moueri&mdash; / uera loquar ueri [<i>Heinsius</i>: uero <i>codd</i>] uix <i>habitura
fidem</i>' and Cic <i>Flac</i> 21 'sed fuerint incorruptae litterae domi; nunc
uero quam <i>habere</i> auctoritatem aut quam <i>fidem</i> possunt?'.</p>

<p><b>51. SI QVIS MIHI DICERET.</b> Compare <i>Tr</i> IV viii 43-44 'hoc mihi si Delphi
Dodonaque diceret ipsa, / esse uideretur uanus uterque locus'.</p>

<p><b>52. GETE</b> is read from the manuscripts by Heinsius; the form is the same
as at <i>Met</i> X 608 'Hippomene uicto', <i>Fast</i> IV 593 'uictore Gyge', <i>EP</i>
II iv 22 'in Aeacide Nestorideque', and <i>EP</i> I viii 6 'dura pharetrato
bella mouente Gete [<i>uar</i> Geta]'. All editors but Heinsius print GETAE,
but this is contrary to Ovid's usage: compare (to take only a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
instances) <i>Ibis</i> 637 '<i>Sarmaticas</i> inter <i>Geticasque sagittas</i>', <i>EP</i> I
i 79 'inque locum <i>Scythico</i> uacuum mutabor ab <i>arcu</i>', and <i>EP</i> III v
45 'ipse quidem <i>Getico</i> peream uiolatus ab <i>arcu</i>'. The only apparent
exceptions to the rule I have found are <i>Tr</i> IV i 21 'Sinti [<i>Ehwald</i>:
inter <i>codd</i> Sintae <i>Iac. Gronouius</i>] nec militis ensem', where the
compound expression alters matters somewhat, and <i>Fast</i> V 580 '<i>Parthi</i>
[<i>uar</i> Parthis] signa retenta <i>manu</i>', where <i>Partha</i> should probably be
read; compare <i>Fast</i> VI 244 '<i>Mauras</i> pertimuere <i>manus</i> [<i>codd</i>: minas
<i>Alton</i>]' and <i>EP</i> I iii 59-60 'altera Bistonias pars est sensura
sarisas, / altera <i>Sarmatica</i> spicula missa <i>manu</i>'.</p>

<p><i>Getes</i> is also used as an adjective at xiii 18 'paene poeta Getes'.</p>

<p><b>53. I BIBE ... ANTICYRA.</b> A hendiadys for 'Go drink all the mind-purging
hellebore that grows in Anticyra'.</p>

<p><b>53. PVRGANTES ... SVCOS.</b> For discussions of <i>elleborus</i> see Theophrastus
<i>HP</i> IX 10, Pliny <i>NH</i> XXV 47-61, and Aulus Gellius XVII xv. There were
two varieties of the plant, black and white (from the colour of their
roots): the former was a laxative, the latter induced vomiting and was
thought to sharpen the intellect; compare Val Max VIII vii ext 5, Pliny
<i>NH</i> XXV 52, Martianus Capella IV 327, and the other passages cited by
Brink at Hor <i>AP</i> 300.</p>

<p><b>54. ANTICYRA.</b> Three places of this name are known from ancient sources;
it is not known which of them Ovid had in mind. One was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> a city in
Locris on the north side of the entrance to the Corinthian Gulf; the
second was a city near Mount Oeta (Strabo IX v 10), and the third an
island of uncertain location (Pliny <i>NH</i> XXV 52). It is possible that
Hor <i>AP</i> 300 'tribus Anticyris caput insanabile' should be taken to mean
that all three places were famous for hellebore, but ps-Acron glosses
<i>tribus Anticyris</i> as 'tribus ... potionibus [<i>Keller</i>: potus <i>codd</i>]
... aut multo elleboro', which Brink accepts, citing Hor <i>Sat</i> II iii
82-83 'danda est ellebori multo pars maxima auaris; / nescio an
Anticyram ratio illis destinet omnem' and Persius IV 16 'Anticyras
... sorbere meracas' for the metonymy, and Petronius 88 4 'Chrysippus, ut
ad inuentionem sufficeret, ter elleboro animum detersit' for the number.
The last two places at least seem to have been known for their
hellebore; compare Pliny <i>NH</i> XXV 49 'plurimum autem nascitur in Oete
monte et optimum uno eius loco circa Pyram' and XXV 52 'Drusum quoque
apud nos ... constat hoc medicamento liberatum comitiali morbo ['epilepsy']
in Anticyra insula'.</p>

a veiled offer of reconciliation: 'et neque nomen in hoc nec dicam facta
libello, / teque breui qui sis dissimulare sinam. / postmodo, <i>si

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="IV_To_Sextus_Pompeius" id="IV_To_Sextus_Pompeius"></a>IV. To Sextus Pompeius</h2>


<p>In this second poem addressed to Sextus Pompeius, Ovid celebrates the
news that Pompeius is to be <i>consul ordinarius</i> in the following year.
As Pompeius was consul in 14, Ovid probably wrote the poem shortly after
the election of magistrates in 13.</p>

<p>Poems iv and v form a pair, the first being an account of Ovid's
reaction on learning of Pompeius' election, the second being a letter to
the new consul. Both poems have points of contact with poem ix, a letter
of congratulation sent to Graecinus on his becoming suffect consul.</p>

<p>The poem begins with general reflections that no sadness is absolute,
which prepare for the description of how the news came to Ovid of
Pompeius' election (1-20). He pictures to himself the ceremonies that
will take place (21-42), and ends with the hope that in the midst of the
festivities Pompeius will still be able to remember him (43-50).</p>

<p><b>1-6.</b> In these lines Ovid reverses the usual ancient sentiment that no
pleasure is unalloyed. Compare Hor <i>Carm</i> II x 17-18 'non, si male nunc,
et olim / sic erit'. For the more usual thought, see <i>Met</i> VII 453-54
'nulla est sincera uoluptas, / sollicitique aliquid laetis interuenit'
and <i>Fast</i> VI 463 'interdum miscentur tristia laetis'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p><b>1. AVSTRALIBVS VMIDA NIMBIS.</b> An image used elsewhere by Ovid as a
metaphor of his unhappiness: see <i>Tr</i> I iii 13 'hanc animo nubem dolor
ipse remouit', <i>Tr</i> V v 22 'pars uitae tristi cetera nube uacet', and
<i>EP</i> II i 5-6 'tandem aliquid pulsa curarum nube serenum ['cloudless']
uidi'.</p>

<p><b>1. VMIDA.</b> For the dampness of the south wind, compare <i>Met</i> I 65-66
'contraria tellus / nubibus assiduis pluuiaque madescit ab Austro'.</p>

<p><b>2. NON INTERMISSIS ... AQVIS.</b> <i>Non intermissis</i> in the same metrical
position at <i>EP</i> I iv 16 'non intermissis cursibus ibit equus';
<i>intermissus</i> used of bad weather at <i>Tr</i> II 149-51 'uentis agitantibus
aera [<i>uar</i> aequora] non est / aequalis rabies continuusque furor, / sed
modo subsidunt <i>intermissique</i> silescunt'.</p>

<p><b>7. DOMO PATRIAQVE CARENS OCVLISQVE MEORVM.</b> Similar phrasing at <i>Tr</i> III
vii 45 'cum caream patria uobisque domoque', <i>Tr</i> III xi 15-16 'quod
coniuge cara, / quod patria careo pignoribusque meis', <i>Tr</i> V v 19 (of
his wife) 'illa domo nataque sua patriaque fruatur', <i>Tr</i> I v 83, <i>Tr</i>
IV vi 19, <i>Tr</i> IV ix 12, <i>Tr</i> V x 47, <i>EP</i> I iii 47, and <i>EP</i> II ix 79.</p>

<p><b>7. OCVLISQVE MEORVM.</b> Compare <i>Tr</i> V iv 27-30 'nec patriam magis ille
suam desiderat ... quam uultus <i>oculosque</i> tuos, o dulcior illo / melle
quod in ceris Attica ponit apis'. <i>Oculisque meorum</i> seems to mean
'regards des miens' (Andr&eacute;) rather than 'the sight of my own' (Wheeler);
compare <i>Aen</i> XI 800-1 'oculosque tulere / cuncti ad reginam',<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> <i>Met</i>
VII 256 'et monet arcanis oculos remouere profanos', Persius V 33
'permisit sparsisse oculos ['to look where I chose']', and from prose
Cic <i>Fam</i> IX ii 2 'ut uitemus oculos hominum'.</p>

<p><b>9. VVLTVM DIFFVNDERE.</b> The action opposite to <i>trahis uultus</i> (i 5);
compare <i>Met</i> XIV 272 'diffudit uultus' and from prose Sen <i>Ep</i> 106 5
'nisi dubitas an uultum nobis mutent, an frontem astringant, an <i>faciem
diffundant</i>'. It is probably from this expression that <i>diffundere</i>
acquired the extended sense of 'mentally relax' (<i>OLD diffundo</i> 5), for
which compare <i>Met</i> IV 766 'diffudere animos', <i>Met</i> III 318 'Iouem
... diffusum nectare', and <i>AA</i> I 218 'diffundetque animos omnibus ista
dies'.</p>

<p><b>9. CAVSAM.</b> CAVSA (<i>BCT</i>) is grammatical enough, but corruption from <i>qua
... causam</i> to <i>qua ... causa</i> is more likely than the inverse.</p>

<p>The construction of the sentence is rather complex: Ovid's normal
practice would be to employ an objective genitive with <i>causa</i>.</p>

<p><b>10. POSSIM</b> <i>BCMHIT</i> POSSEM <i>L</i> POSSVM <i>F</i>. The clause is in primary tense
sequence following the true perfect <i>inueni</i>, which represents the
present result of a past action. Compare <i>fecit ... minuant</i> in 5-6.</p>

<p><b>10. NEC MEMINISSE</b> = <i>et obliuisci</i>. <i>Nec (non) meminisse</i> is metrically
useful for filling the second hemistich of the pentameter up to the
disyllable; so used at vi 50 'arguat ingratum non meminisse sui', <i>Tr</i>
IV iv 40 &amp; V xiii 18, and <i>EP</i> II iv 6.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p><b>11. SOLVS</b> <i>BC</i>. TRISTIS, the reading of the other six manuscripts, is
tempting, as being the less neutral of the two adjectives, and was
accepted without question by Heinsius and Burman. If it is accepted, one
could argue that Ovid refers back to the word at 21 'dilapsis ... curis'.
But <i>solus</i> is shown to be correct by the passage Ovid is here
imitating, Virgil <i>G</i> I 388-89 'tum cornix plena pluuiam uocat improba
uoce / et <i>sola</i> in sicca secum <i>spatiatur harena</i>'. <i>Solus</i> was lost
through haplography ('fulua solus': the elongated 's' form common in
manuscripts would have facilitated the error) and <i>tristis</i> interpolated
to restore the metre. Ehwald believed (<i>KB</i> 63) that the error arose
from <i>tristis</i> having been written above <i>solus</i> in the archetype, but
there is no reason to accept this, since the one could not stand as a
gloss for the other.</p>

<p><b>11. SPATIARER HARENA.</b> The phrase is taken from Virgil <i>G</i> I 388-89
(quoted in the previous note); Ovid imitates the passage again at <i>Met</i>
II 572-73 'lentis / passibus, ut soleo, summa <i>spatiarer harena</i>'.</p>

<p><b>12. VISA EST A TERGO PENNA DEDISSE SONVM.</b> 'I thought I heard a wing
rustle behind me'. A similar advent of an unseen deity at <i>Met</i> III
96-98 'uox subito audita est; neque erat cognoscere promptum / unde, sed
audita est: "quid, Agenore nate, peremptum / serpentem spectas? et tu
spectabere serpens"'. Compare as well <i>Met</i> V 294-98 'Musa loquebatur:
pennae sonuere per auras, / uoxque salutantum ramis ueniebat ab altis. /
suspicit et linguae quaerit tam certa loquentes / unde sonent hominemque
putat Ioue nata locutum; / ales erat'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p><b>12. PENNA</b> <i>BMFHILT</i> PINNA <i>C</i>. <i>Pinna</i> and <i>penna</i>, perhaps from
different roots, were confused even in antiquity. The ancient
manuscripts of Virgil offer <i>pinna</i> as the spelling even for the meaning
'wing', but Quintilian clearly took <i>penna</i> as the correct spelling for
this sense: 'quare ['therefore'] discat puer ... quae cum quibus
cognatio; nec miretur cur ... a pinno quod est acutum [<i>sc</i> fiat] securis
utrimque habens aciem <i>bipennis</i>, ne illorum sequatur errorem qui, quia
a pennis duabus hoc esse nomen existimant, pennas auium dici uolunt'. (I
iv 12).</p>

<p><b>13. NEQVE ERAT</b> <i>CMHL</i> NEC ERAT <i>BFIT</i>. Virgil had a very strong
preference for <i>neque</i> before words starting with a vowel, but Ovid did
not follow this rule: compare <i>Met</i> I 101 'nec ullis', 132 'nec adhuc',
223 'nec erit', 306 'nec ablato', and 322 'nec amantior'. However, it
seems better to accept <i>neque</i> as the true reading in view of the good
manuscript support and the parallel at <i>Met</i> III 96-97 'uox subita
audita est (neque [<i>uar</i> nec] erat cognoscere promptum / unde, sed
audita est)'.</p>

<p><b>13. NEQVE ERAT CORPVS.</b> 'But there was no body'. <i>Neque</i> (<i>nec</i>)
represents <i>sed ... non</i> as well as <i>et ... non</i>.</p>

<p>It is one of Ovid's favourite devices to describe the aspect of gods
when they appear to him, as at <i>Am</i> III i 7-14 (Elegy and Tragedy),
<i>Fast</i> I 95-100 (Janus), <i>Fast</i> III 171-72 (Mars), <i>Fast</i> V 194 (Flora),
<i>Fast</i> V 637-38 (Tiber), and <i>EP</i> III iii 13-20 (Amor). The only other
passage where Ovid says he did not see the god is <i>Fast</i> VI 251-54, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Vesta had no traditional appearance that Ovid could make use of: compare
<i>Fast</i> VI 298 'effigiem nullam Vesta ... habet'.</p>

<p>The reason that Ovid did not describe Fama was that the picture of Fama
as a winged monster which Virgil had made standard (<i>Aen</i> IV 174-88)
could not easily be integrated into the poem. The only description of
Fama in Ovid is at <i>Met</i> IX 137-39 'Fama loquax praecessit ad aures, /
Deianira, tuas, quae ueris addere falsa / gaudet, et e minima sua per
mendacia crescit'. At <i>Met</i> XII 39-63 there is a memorable description
of Fama's dwelling-place. Fama is also personified (but with no
descriptions) at <i>EP</i> II i 19-20 &amp; II ix 3.</p>

<p><b>16. PER IMMENSAS AERE LAPSA VIAS.</b> Similar phrasing at <i>EP</i> III iii 77-78
(Amor speaking) 'ut tamen aspicerem consolarerque iacentem, / <i>lapsa per
immensas est mea penna uias</i>'.</p>

<p><b>17. QVO NON TIBI CARIOR ALTER.</b> Compare <i>Tr</i> III vi 3 'nec te mihi carior
alter', <i>Tr</i> IV vi 46 'qua nulla mihi carior, uxor', and <i>EP</i> II viii 27
'per patriae nomen, quae te tibi carior ipso est'.</p>

<p><b>18. CANDIDVS ET FELIX PROXIMVS ANNVS ERIT.</b> Compare <i>Fast</i> I 63-64 'ecce
tibi <i>faustum</i>, Germanice, nuntiat <i>annum</i> / inque meo primus carmine
Ianus adest'. No doubt both passages echo the phrasing of a New Year
wish or prayer.</p>

<p><b>18. CANDIDVS.</b> 'Favourable'. Compare <i>Tr</i> V v 13-14 (on his wife's
birthday) 'optime natalis! quamuis procul absumus, opto / <i>candidus</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
huc uenias', Prop IV i 67-68 'Roma, faue, tibi surgit opus, date
<i>candida</i> ciues / omina, et inceptis dextera cantet auis!', and <i>Fast</i> I
79-80 'uestibus intactis Tarpeias itur in arces, / et populus <i>festo
concolor</i> ipse suo est'.</p>

<p><b>19. DIXIT ET</b> has a definite epic flavour, being found in Virgil at <i>Aen</i>
I 402 &amp; 736, II 376, III 258, IV 659, V 477, VI 677, VIII 366 &amp; 615, IX
14, X 867, XI 561 &amp; 858, XII 266 &amp; 681, and <i>G</i> IV 499; from Ovid
compare <i>Met</i> I 466-67 'dixit et eliso percussis aere pennis / impiger
umbrosa Parnasi constitit arce', I 762 'dixit et implicuit materno
bracchia collo', III 474, IV 162 &amp; 576, V 230 &amp; 419, VIII 101, and VIII
757. A close parallel at <i>EP</i> III iii 93-94 (Amor has been speaking with
Ovid) 'dixit et aut ille est tenues dilapsus in auras, / coeperunt
sensus aut uigilare mei'.</p>

<p><b>22. EXCIDIT.</b> 'I forgot'; the opposite of <i>subit</i> 'I remember'. The idiom
is standard Latin (<i>OLD excido<sup>1</sup></i> 9b); Ovidian instances at <i>Her</i> XII 71,
<i>Am</i> II i 18, <i>Met</i> VIII 449-50 'excidit omnis / luctus et a lacrimis in
poenae uersus amorem est', <i>Met</i> XIV 139, <i>Fast</i> V 315, <i>Tr</i> I v 14,
<i>EP</i> II iv 24, and <i>EP</i> II x 8 'exciderit tantum ne tibi cura mei'.</p>

<p><b>23. VBI ... RESERAVERIS ANNVM.</b> 'When you have unlocked the year'. Compare
Ovid's descriptions of Janus at <i>Fast</i> I 99 'tenens baculum dextra
<i>clauemque</i> sinistra' and <i>Fast</i> I 253-54 '"nil mihi cum bello: pacem
postesque tuebar / et" <i>clauem</i> ostendens "haec" ait "arma gero"'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p><b>23. LONGVM ANNVM.</b> Andr&eacute; translates, 'l'ann&eacute;e longue &agrave; venir', citing Cic
<i>Phil</i> V 1 'Nihil umquam longius his Kalendiis Ianuariis mihi uisum
est', to which <i>OLD longus</i> 14a adds (among other passages) Caesar <i>BG</i>
I 40 13 'in longiorem diem collaturus' and Sen <i>Ep</i> 63 3 'non differo in
<i>longius</i> tempus'; but the meaning 'far off' seems unsuited to the
present context. <i>Longum</i> should be taken in its usual sense; it perhaps
emphasizes that the whole year is still ahead.</p>

<p><b>24. SACRO MENSE.</b> <i>Sacer</i> because of the religious ceremonies marking the
New Year.</p>

<p><b>25-28.</b> The first action of the new consul was to take auspices at his
home and to assume the consular toga: compare Livy XXI 63 10 (217 BC;
Flaminius has entered his consulship while absent from Rome) 'magis pro
maiestate uidelicet imperii Arimini quam Romae magistratum initurum et
in deuersorio hospitali quam apud penates suos praetextam sumpturum'
(Mommsen <i>Staatsrecht</i> I<sup>3</sup> 615-17).</p>

<p><b>26. NE TITVLIS QVICQVAM DEBEAT ILLE SVIS.</b> There are two possible ways of
understanding this line.</p>

<p>One way is to take <i>titulis</i> as referring to Pompeius' earlier
magistracies, 'as if the series of offices were a score which Pompey
would pay in full when he became consul' (Wheeler). A similar use at
<i>Her</i> IX 1 'Gratulor Oechaliam titulis accedere nostris'.</p>

<p><i>Titulis</i> does not have to be taken as a strict reference to the offices
Pompeius had already held, but can have the wider sense of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> 'reputation,
honour'. Compare the opening line of <i>Her</i> IX quoted above; Professor R.
J. Tarrant cites <i>Met</i> XV 855 'sic magnus cedit <i>titulis</i> Agamemnonis
Atreus' and Juvenal VIII 241.</p>

<p>The second way to take the passage is, with N&eacute;methy, to understand
<i>titulis ... suis</i> as being equivalent to <i>maioribus suis, qui magnos
titulos habent</i>, the <i>tituli</i> being the inscriptions below the
<i>imagines</i> of Pompeius' ancestors. A parallel for the sense at <i>EP</i> III
i 75-76 'hoc domui <i>debes</i> de qua censeris, ut illam / non magis
officiis quam probitate colas'. Professor E. Fantham suggests a
refinement: <i>titulis ... suis</i> should be taken in the sense 'achievements
of his ancestors'. Compare Prop IV xi 32 'et domus est titulis utraque
fulta suis'.</p>

<p><b>27. PAENE ATRIA.</b> Heinsius preferred PENETRALIA, the reading of <i>I</i> and
<i>F<sup>2</sup></i> ('sed ne sic quidem locus mihi uidetur plane in integrum
restitutus'), apparently objecting to <i>paene</i>. The word seems weak
enough, especially in view of Virgil <i>G</i> I 49 'illius immensae
<i>ruperunt</i> horrea messes', but Professor R. J. Tarrant points out to me
a similarly weak <i>paene</i> at <i>Tr</i> III xi 13-14 'sic ego belligeris a
gentibus undique saeptus / terreor, hoste meum paene premente latus'.
Burman conjectured LAETA and PLENA; neither seems very convincing.</p>

<p>For <i>atria</i> compare <i>Her</i> XVI 185-86 'occurrent denso tibi Troades
agmine matres, / nec capient Phrygias <i>atria</i> nostra nurus'.
<i>Penetralia</i>, although poorly attested, is in itself appropriate enough,
since the new consul began his magistracy in front of his <i>penates</i>:
Festus (Mueller 208; Lindsay 231) defined the <i>penetralia</i> as the
'penatium deorum sacraria'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p><b>28. ET POPVLVM LAEDI DEFICIENTE LOCO.</b> The jostling of a crowd similarly
described at <i>Am</i> III ii 21-22 'tu tamen a dextra, quicumque es, parce
puellae; / contactu lateris laeditur ista tui'.</p>

<p><b>29-34.</b> The new consul, accompanied by lictors, left his house and went
in solemn procession to the Capitoline, where he took his place on the
curule chair, and then sacrificed to Iuppiter Optimus Maximus. A meeting
of the Senate followed, held in the temple of Jupiter.</p>

<p>At ix 17-32 Ovid gives a similar description of the consul's entering on
his office.</p>

<p><b>29. TARPEIAE ... SEDIS.</b> <i>Capitolinus</i> is metrically awkward; hence the
synecdoche from the <i>Tarpeia rupes</i>, the part of the Capitoline from
which criminals were hurled. Similar tropes at viii 42 'uictima Tarpeios
inficit icta focos', ix 29 'at cum Tarpeias esses deductus in arces',
and commonly in the poets.</p>

<p><b>30. FACILES IN TVA VOTA.</b> 'Receptive to your prayers'; for this frequent
sense of <i>facilis</i> compare <i>Her</i> XII 84 'sed mihi tam <i>faciles</i> unde
meosque deos?', <i>Met</i> V 559 'optastis <i>facilesque</i> deos habuistis', <i>Tr</i>
IV i 53 'sint precor hae [the Muses] saltem <i>faciles</i> mihi', <i>EP</i> II ii
19-20 'esse ... fateor ... <i>difficilem</i> precibus te quoque iure meis',
<i>Her</i> XVI 282 'sic habeas <i>faciles in tua uota deos</i>', and Grattius 426.</p>

<p><b>31-32.</b> The asyndeton in this distich is odd, given the preceding series
of connectives. If the text is unsound, however, alteration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> of <i>certae</i>
to <i>certant</i> (Damst&eacute;) or <i>cerno</i> (Owen) is not the cure. By using
<i>certae</i> Ovid is indicating that there will be a clean blow with the
axe, a good omen for the coming year. For the opposite omen, see <i>Aen</i>
II 222-24 (describing Laocoon) 'clamores simul horrendos ad sidera
tollit: / qualis mugitus, fugit cum saucius aram / taurus et <i>incertam</i>
excussit ceruice securim'.</p>

<p><b>31-32. BOVES NIVEOS ... QVOS ALVIT CAMPIS HERBA FALISCA SVIS.</b> Compare
<i>Am</i> III xiii 13-14 'ducuntur <i>niueae</i> populo plaudente <i>iuuencae</i>, /
<i>quas aluit campis herba Falisca suis</i>' and <i>Fast</i> I 83-84 (a
description of the sacrifices on January 1st) '<i>colla</i> rudes operum
<i>praebent</i> ferienda iuuenci, / <i>quos aluit campis herba Falisca suis</i>'.</p>

<p><b>33-34. CVMQVE DEOS OMNES, TVM QVOS IMPENSIVS AEQVOS / ESSE TIBI CVPIAS,
CVM IOVE CAESAR ERVNT.</b> <i>Cupias</i> must be supplied with <i>deos omnes</i>&mdash;'You
will wish the favour of all the gods; those gods whose favour you will
particularly wish will be Caesar and Jupiter'. The omission of the verb
from the <i>cum</i>-clause seems very strange, however, and Ehwald (<i>KB</i>
63-64) is possibly correct in supposing a distich to have fallen from
the text after 32; in this case, <i>cumque deos omnes</i> is probably far
removed from its original form.</p>

<p><b>33. OMNES, TVM QVOS.</b> Ehwald wished to read OMNES, TVNC HOS (<i>P</i> reads
TVNC HOS ORES), <i>hos</i> referring to the gods of the Capitol who had been
named in the distich missing after 32; but this would leave <i>cum Ioue
Caesar erunt</i> without a predicate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p><b>33. AEQVOS.</b> 'Favourable'; compare <i>Her</i> I 23 'sed bene consuluit casto
deus <i>aequus</i> amori'; <i>Tr</i> I ii 6 '<i>aequa</i> Venus Teucris, Pallas
<i>iniqua</i> fuit', <i>Tr</i> III xiv 29 '<i>aequus</i> erit scriptis', and <i>Tr</i> IV i
25.</p>

<p><b>35. E MORE VOCATI.</b> 'Convened, as is traditional'. After the sacrifice on
the Capitoline, the new consul addressed the assembled Senate; compare
Livy XXVI 26 5 'M. Marcellus cum idibus Martiis consulatum inisset,
senatum eo die <i>moris modo causa</i> habuit ['held a session of the Senate
simply because it was traditional to do so']' and Livy XXI 63 8 'ne die
initi magistratus Iouis optimi maximi templum adiret, ne senatum inuisus
ipse et sibi uni inuisum uideret consuleretque'.</p>

<p><b>36. INTENDENT AVRES.</b> The expression is not found elsewhere in Ovid, or
in Virgil; but compare Manilius II 511 'at nudus Geminis <i>intendit</i>
Aquarius <i>aurem</i>'. The expression is presumably an extension of <i>oculos
(aciem) intendere</i>, for which see Cic <i>Tusc</i> IV 38, <i>Ac</i> II 80, and Tac
<i>Ann</i> IV 70.</p>

<p><b>37. FACVNDO TVA VOX ... ORE.</b> For Pompeius' eloquence, N&eacute;methy cites Val
Max II vi 8 '<i>facundissimo</i> ... sermone, qui ore eius quasi e beato
quodam eloquentiae fonte manabat' and IV vii ext 2 'clarissimi ac
<i>disertissimi</i> uiri'.</p>

<p><b>37. HILARAVERIT.</b> The verb is rare and elevated in tone. Compare Cic
<i>Brut</i> 44 (of Pericles' oratory) 'huius suauitate maxime hilaratae
Athenae sunt', Catullus LXIII 18, and <i>Ecl</i> V 69.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p><b>38. VTQVE SOLET, TVLERIT PROSPERA VERBA DIES.</b> Compare <i>Fast</i> I 175-76
(Ovid to Janus) '"at cur <i>laeta</i> tuis dicuntur <i>uerba</i> Kalendis, / et
damus alternas accipimusque preces?"'.</p>

<p><b>40.</b> Riese's punctuation 'facias cur ita, saepe dabit' seems preferable
to the alternate 'facias cur ita saepe, dabit', as placing more emphasis
on Augustus and being perhaps an echo of <i>Tr</i> IV ii 12 'munera det
meritis, <i>saepe datura</i>, deis'.</p>

<p><b>42. OFFICIVM POPVLI</b> = <i>populum officium facientem</i>; the same metonymy at
<i>Met</i> XV 691-93 (of Aesculapius) 'restitit hic agmenque suum <i>turbaeque
sequentis</i> / <i>officium</i> placido uisus dimittere uultu / corpus in
Ausonia posuit rate'.</p>

<p><b>44. NEC POTERVNT ISTIS LVMINA NOSTRA FRVI.</b> Other non-personal subjects
at Cic <i>Am</i> 45 (<i>animus</i>) and ps-Quint <i>Decl</i> VII 10 'uulneribus illis
non fruentur <i>oculi</i>'. In all of these passages the transition from an
expressed personal subject to a faculty or part of the personality seems
fairly natural.</p>

<p><b>45. QVAMLIBET</b> is a correction by Heinsius: 'far away as you might be
...'. The QVOD (QVA) LICET of most manuscripts anticipates the following
<i>qua possum</i>, contrary to Ovid's practice.</p>

<p><b>45. QVA POSSVM, MENTE.</b> A commonplace of the poems of exile: compare ix
41-42 'mente tamen, quae sola domo non exulat, usus / praetextam fasces
aspiciamque tuos', <i>Tr</i> III iv 56, <i>Tr</i> IV ii 57 'haec ego summotus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>

<h2><a name="V_To_Sextus_Pompeius" id="V_To_Sextus_Pompeius"></a>V. To Sextus Pompeius</h2>


<p>The poem was written shortly after Pompeius' accession to the consulship
(compare 4 'tectaque brumali sub niue terra latet' and 24 'deque <i>parum
noto</i> consulet officio'). It takes the form of a set of instructions to
the poem on what it should do when it reaches Rome. Ovid tells the poem
it should look for Pompeius, and includes a short description of some of
the consular functions Pompeius might be carrying out (1-26). He then
instructs the poem in what it is to say to Pompeius: it should describe
to him Ovid's gratitude for past and present services, and promise
(using several <i>adynata</i> as illustrations) that this gratitude will be
eternal (27-46).</p>

<p>A close parallel to this poem is furnished by <i>Tr</i> III vii, in which
Ovid tells the poem where it is to seek his stepdaughter Perilla and
what it is to say to her. Similar personifications are found in <i>Tr</i> I
i, in which Ovid gives instructions to his book on what it should do
when it reaches Rome and the prudence it should show, in <i>Tr</i> III i,
where the book describes its arrival in Rome, in <i>Tr</i> V iv, where the
letter tells of Ovid's misery and his loyalty to his friend, and in
Ovid's exhortation to his <i>elegi</i> at <i>Fast</i> II 3-6. The device is not
unique to Ovid, being found at Catullus XXXV, Hor <i>Ep</i> I xx, and Statius
<i>Sil</i> IV iv.</p>

<p><b>1. LEVES ELEGI.</b> The same phrase at Am II i 21 'blanditias <i>elegosque
leues</i>, mea tela, resumpsi'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p><b>1. DOCTAS AD CONSVLIS AVRES.</b> 'To the ears of a consul who appreciates
poetry'. Compare Hor <i>Ep</i> I xiii 17-18 'carmina quae possint oculos
<i>aurisque</i> morari / Caesaris' and Prop II xiii 11-12.</p>

<p><b>2. HONORATO ... VIRO.</b> Dative of agent with <i>legenda</i>.</p>

<p><b>2. HONORATO</b> refers specifically to Pompeius' consulship. <i>Honor</i> is
often used with the restricted sense of 'magistracy'.</p>

<p><b>3. LONGA VIA EST.</b> Compare <i>Tr</i> I i 127-28 (the end of Ovid's
instructions to his book) 'longa uia est, propera! nobis habitabitur
orbis / ultimus, a terra terra remota mea'.</p>

<p><b>3. LONGA VIA EST, NEC VOS PEDIBVS PROCEDITIS AEQVIS.</b> The <i>uia longa</i> is
seen as a possible cause of the metre's lameness at <i>Tr</i> III i 11-12.</p>

<p><b>3. NEC ... PEDIBVS ... AEQVIS.</b> Ovid often mentions the alternating pattern
of elegiac verse: compare xvi 11 <i>numeris ... imparibus ... uel aequis</i>
and the passages there cited, <i>Am</i> III i 8 (of Elegy) 'et, puto, pes
illi <i>longior alter</i> erat', and <i>EP</i> III iv 85-86 'ferre etiam molles
elegi tam uasta triumphi / pondera <i>disparibus</i> non potuere <i>rotis</i>'.</p>

<p><b>5. HAEMON</b> <i>Laurentianus 38 39 (saec xv), Ven. Marcianus XII 106 (saec
xv), editio princeps Bononiensis</i> HAEMVM <i>BCMFHILT</i>. I follow Heinsius
and Burman in printing <i>Haemon</i>, in consideration of the preceding
<i>Thracen</i>: it seems neater to have both place-names in their Greek
forms. <i>Haemum</i> is similarly the transmitted reading at <i>Met</i> VI 87 (of
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> tapestry created by Minerva) 'Threiciam Rhodopen habet angulus unus
et <i>Haemon</i>' and <i>Met</i> X 76-77 (of Orpheus) 'in altam / se recipit
Rhodopen pulsumque Aquilonibus <i>Haemon</i>', the preferable <i>Haemon</i> being
found only in certain late manuscripts.</p>

<p><b>6. TRANSIER&#298;TIS.</b> In early Latin this would necessarily have been a
perfect subjunctive, the future perfect indicative being
<i>transier&#301;tis</i> with the second 'i' short; but after Ennius and Plautus
the forms (like
<i>-er&#299;s</i> and <i>-er&#301;s)</i>) are used indifferently, according to metrical
necessity. See Platnauer 56 and K&uuml;hner-Stegmann I 115-16.</p>

<p><b>7. LVCE MINVS DECIMA DOMINAM VENIETIS IN VRBEM.</b> '[Starting from
Brundisium] you will arrive in Rome before the tenth day'. The same
idiom at <i>Fast</i> V 379 'nocte minus quarta promet sua sidera Chiron'.</p>

<p><b>8. VT FESTINATVM NON FACIATIS ITER.</b> The trip would probably be not much
shorter than ten days. Andr&eacute; cites Livy XXXVI 21 and Plutarch <i>Cato
maior</i> 14 3 for Cato's five-day journey from Hydruntum (Livy; Hydruntum
is about seventy-five kilometres southeast of Brundisium) or Brundisium
(Plutarch) in 191 to announce the victory over Antiochus III at
Thermopylae; both authors mention the journey for its speed. The more
leisurely journey from Rome to Brundisium described in Hor <i>Sat</i> I v
seems to have taken about fifteen days; see Palmer on I v 103.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Either <b>PETETVR</b> (<i>FT</i>) or PETATVR (<i>BCMHIL</i>) is possible enough.
<i>Petetur</i> seems the better reading in view of <i>uenietis</i> (7) and <i>erit</i>
(16), the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> corruption perhaps having been induced by <i>faciatis</i> in the
preceding line. But the jussive <i>petatur</i> could be continuing from <i>ite</i>
in the first line; compare Statius <i>Sil</i> IV iv 4-5 'atque ubi Romuleas
uelox penetraueris arces, / continuo dextras flaui <i>pete</i> Thybridis
oras'.</p>

<p><b>10. NON EST AVGVSTO IVNCTIOR VLLA FORO.</b> Compare xv 16 'quam domus [<i>sc</i>
tua] Augusto continuata foro'.</p>

<p><b>11. SI QVIS VT IN POPULO.</b> 'If someone in the crowd'. This seems to be
the sense of <i>ut in populo</i>; Wheeler's translation 'as may happen in the
crowd' will work here and at <i>Tr</i> I i 17-18 'si quis <i>ut in populo</i>
nostri non immemor illi [=<i>illic</i>], / si quis qui quid agam forte
requirat, erit', but not at <i>Tr</i> II 157-58 'per patriam, quae te tuta et
secura parente est, / cuius <i>ut in populo</i> pars ego nuper eram' or at
Hor <i>Sat</i> I vi 78-80 (Horace describes his schooldays) 'uestem seruosque
sequentis / <i>in magno ut populo</i> si qui uidisset, auita / ex re praeberi
sumptus mihi crederet illos'.</p>

<p>A similar idiom appears at <i>Tr</i> II 231-32 'denique <i>ut in tanto</i> quantum
non extitit umquam / <i>corpore</i> pars nulla est quae labet imperii'</p>

<p><b>11. QVI SITIS ET VNDE.</b> Similar phrasing at <i>Ilias Lat</i> 554-55 'nomen
genusque roganti, / <i>qui sit et unde'</i>.</p>

<p><b>12. NOMINA ... QVAELIBET ... FERAT.</b> <i>Ferat</i> = 'receive as answer'. Compare
Livy V 32 8 '[M. Furius Camillus] cum accitis domum tribulibus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>clientibusque ... percontatus animos eorum <i>responsum tulisset</i> se

<p><b>14. VERA, MINVS</b> <i>Hilberg</i> VERBA MINVS <i>codd</i>. For the phrase <i>uera
fateri</i> Hilberg (35-36) cited as parallels <i>Met</i> VII 728 &amp; IX 53, <i>Tr</i> I
ix 16, <i>EP</i> III i 79 'si uis <i>uera fateri</i>', <i>EP</i> III ix 19 'quid enim
dubitem tibi <i>uera fateri</i>?', to which add <i>EP</i> II iii 7. For the
contrast of <i>uera</i> and <i>ficta</i> Hilberg cited <i>EP</i> III iv 105-6 'oppida
turritis cingantur eburnea muris, / <i>fictaque</i> res <i>uero</i> [<i>codd</i>: uerae
<i>Riese</i>] more putetur agi'; see as well <i>Tr</i> I ix 15-16 'haec precor ut
semper possint tibi <i>falsa</i> uideri; / sunt tamen euentu <i>uera fatenda</i>
meo'. For the corruption of <i>uera</i> to <i>uerba</i> he cited <i>Fast</i> I 332,
<i>Tr</i> III vi 36, III xi 33 &amp; IV iii 58, and Prop III xxiv 12 'naufragus
Aegaea uera [<i>Passerat</i>: uerba <i>codd</i>] fatebar [<i>uar</i> fatebor] aqua';
for the position of <i>uera</i> he cited <i>EP</i> III i 46 &amp; IV xiii 26. The
corruption was no doubt assisted by the isolated position of <i>uera</i> at
the start of the pentameter.</p>

<p><b>15-16. COPIA NEC VOBIS NVLLO PROHIBENTE VIDENDI / CONSULIS ... ERIT.</b>
'Even if no one stops you, you will not be able to see the consul
[because he will be busy]'. Heinsius preferred to read VLLO (<i>P</i>), but
this does not yield sense: it would have to mean 'you will be able to
see the consul if no one prevents you' or 'you will be unable to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
the consul if anyone prevents you'; neither of these meanings would
cohere with what follows.</p>

<p><b>15. COPIA.</b> 'Opportunity'; compare <i>Met</i> XI 278 '<i>copia</i> ... facta est
adeundi tecta tyranni', <i>EP</i> III i 135-37 'cum domus Augusti ... laeta
... plenaque pacis erit, / tum tibi di faciant adeundi <i>copia</i> fiat',
and <i>Aen</i> I 520 'coram data <i>copia</i> fandi', XI 248 (=I 520) &amp; XI 378.</p>

<p><b>16. CONTIGER&#298;TIS.</b> See on 6 <i>transier&#299;tis</i>.</p>

<p><b>17. DICENDO IVRA.</b> The plural is poetic, the standard phrase being <i>ius
dicere</i>: <i>OLD ius<sup>2</sup></i> 4b cites Livy III 52 6 alone for the plural.</p>

<p><b>17-26.</b> Ovid lists in order of ascending importance some of the
activities Pompeius as consul might be engaged in, starting with the
hearing of lawsuits and ending with visits to the imperial family. For a
shorter instance of the device of listing the recipient's possible
activities, see <i>Tr</i> III vii 3-4 (Ovid tells his letter to seek Perilla)
'aut illam inuenies dulci cum matre sedentem, / aut inter libros
Pieridasque suas'.</p>

<p><b>18. CONSPICVVM ... SIGNIS EBVR.</b> <i>Signis</i> = 'bas-relief'; the sense is
confined to verse (<i>OLD signum</i> 12b). Compare ix 27 'signa ... in sella
... formata curuli', <i>Met</i> V 80-82 'altis / extantem signis ... cratera',
<i>Met</i> XII 235-36 'signis extantibus asper / antiquus crater', <i>Met</i> XIII
700, Lucr V 1427-28 'ueste ... purpurea atque auro signisque ingentibus
apta', <i>Aen</i> V 267, V 536 &amp; IX 263, Prop IV v 24, Statius <i>Theb</i> I 540,
and Silius II 432.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p><b>18. CVM PREMET ALTVS EBUR.</b> 'When he sits tall on the curule chair'. The
same situation similarly described at <i>Fast</i> I 81-82 'iamque noui
praeeunt fasces, noua purpura fulget, / et noua conspicuum pondera
sentit ebur'; compare as well <i>Med Fac</i> 13 'matrona <i>premens altum</i>
rubicunda sedile' and <i>Met</i> V 317 'factaque de uiuo <i>pressere</i> sedilia
saxo'.</p>

<p><b>19. REDITVS ... COMPONET.</b> 'Will be arranging the [state's] income'. For
<i>reditus</i> compare <i>Am</i> I x 41 'turpe tori <i>reditu</i> census augere
paternos' and <i>EP</i> II iii 17-18 'at <i>reditus</i> iam quisque suos amat, et
sibi quid sit / utile sollicitis supputat ['calculates'] articulis'. For
<i>componet</i> compare Cic <i>II Verr</i> IV 36 '<i>compone</i> hoc quod postulo de
argento' and Tac <i>Ann</i> VI 16 5.</p>

<p><b>19. POSITAM ... AD HASTAM.</b> A spear placed in the ground was a symbol of
magisterial authority, and as such was always present at the letting of
tax contracts. For the language compare Cic <i>Leg Agr</i> II 53 'ponite ante
oculos uobis Rullum ... <i>hasta posita</i> ... auctionantem'. For <i>hasta</i> with
the specific meaning of 'contract-letting', see Livy XXIV 18 11
'conuenere ad eos frequentes qui <i>hastae huius generis</i> adsueuerant'.
The practice is recalled in the modern Italian term for 'auction',
<i>uendita all'asta</i>.</p>

<p><b>20. MINVI MAGNAE.</b> A word play on <i>minus</i> and <i>magis</i> at least; but
Professor E. Fantham points out to me that Ovid probably had in mind the
phrase <i>maiestatem populi Romani minuere</i> (Cic <i>Inu</i> II 53 &amp; <i>Phil</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> I
21); Pompeius will not allow the interests of the state to be damaged.</p>

<p><b>21. IN IVLIA TEMPLA</b> = <i>in curiam Iuliam</i>. Caesar had started the
construction of a new senate-house in 44; it was opened by Augustus in
29. The building, as restored by Diocletian, survives substantially
intact: see Nash I 301.</p>

<p><b>22. TANTO DIGNIS CONSVLE REBVS.</b> Note the separation of the epithets from
the nouns, and the high level of diction produced by the hyperbaton.</p>

<p><b>23. AVT FERET ... SOLITAM ... SALVTEM</b> = <i>aut, ut solet, salutabit</i>.</p>

<p><b>23. NATOQVE.</b> Tiberius, son of Ti. Claudius Nero, had been adopted by
Augustus in AD 4.</p>

<p><b>24. DEQVE PARVM NOTO CONSVLET OFFICIO.</b> 'Will be asking advice about his
unfamiliar office'. It still being winter, Pompeius would not have been
very long in office, and so would not yet have been very familiar with
his duties. Burman objected to this notion ('nec Ovidium tam adulandi
imperitum fuisse puto, ut ignorantiam aut seruitutem tam imprudenter
obiiceret Pompeio') and conjectured DEQVE PATRVM TOTO CONSVLET OFFICIO,
that is, 'consulet Caesares, <i>quale uelint esse officium</i> totius
senatus'. But the conjecture is unattractive, and the problem not as
great as Burman thought: both Ovid and Pompeius would wish to emphasize
the importance of the Caesars.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p><b>25. AB HIS VACVVM.</b> A prose usage, paralleled in Ovid by <i>EP</i> I i 79
alone 'inque locum Scythico <i>uacuum</i> mutabor <i>ab arcu</i>'. Elsewhere Ovid
has nine instances of <i>uacuus</i> with the simple ablative and two
instances of <i>uacuus</i> with the genitive, while Virgil never has <i>uacuus</i>
with a complement. ET HIS VACVVM, given by <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, is perhaps an
attempt to restore normal poetic idiom.</p>

<p><b>26. A MAGNIS ... DEIS.</b> 'After the great gods'&mdash;Augustus and Tiberius. Dio
says that it was remarked after Augustus' death that both of the consuls
for the year were related to the emperor (LVI 29 5); it is strange that
Ovid nowhere mentions Pompeius' link with the imperial family.</p>

<p>For the sense of <i>ab</i>, compare for example <i>Ecl</i> V 48-49 'nec calamis
solum aequiperas, sed uoce magistrum: / fortunate puer, tu nunc eris
alter <i>ab illo</i>' and Statius <i>Theb</i> IV 842.</p>

<p><b>27. CVM TAMEN ... REQVIEVERIT.</b> After it has arrived in Rome, the poem
should not vex Pompeius by approaching him when he is busy. At <i>Tr</i> I i
93-96 Ovid in the same way advises his book when it should approach
Augustus, and at <i>EP</i> III i 135-40 gives similar directions to his wife.
Compare as well <i>Met</i> IX 572-73 (a messenger carries Byblis' declaration
of love to her brother) 'apta minister / tempora nactus adit traditque
fatentia [<i>H. A. Koch</i>: latentia <i>codd</i>] uerba' and <i>Met</i> IX 610-12
(Byblis' explanation of the failure of her suit) 'forsitan et missi sit
quaedam culpa ministri: / non adiit apte, nec legit idonea, credo, /
tempora, nec petiit <i>horam animumque uacantem</i>'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p><b>27. A TVRBA RERVM.</b> 'De ces multiples affaires' (Andr&eacute;). Heinsius
conjectured CVRA, citing ix 71 (addressed to Graecinus as consul) 'cum
tamen <i>a rerum cura</i> propiore uacabit'. The conjecture is elegant
enough, but the manuscript reading seems sufficiently supported by <i>Her</i>
II 75-76 (Phyllis to Demophoon) 'de tanta <i>rerum turba</i> factisque
parentis / sedit in ingenio Cressa relicta tuo' and <i>EP</i> III i 144 'per
<i>rerum turbam</i> tu quoque oportet eas'; compare as well Columella XI 2
25.</p>

<p><b>28. MANSVETAS ... MANVS.</b> The same phrase in the same position at Prop III
xvi 9-10 'peccaram semel, et totum sum pulsus in annum: / in me
<i>mansuetas</i> non habet illa <i>manus</i>'. <i>Mansuetus</i> is foreign to poetic
vocabulary, not being found in Virgil or Horace, and only three times in
Propertius (I ix 12, I xvii 28, III xvi 10): in Ovid it occurs elsewhere
only at <i>Tr</i> III vi 23 'numinis ut laesi fiat mansuetior ira' and <i>Ibis</i>
26.</p>

<p><b>28. PORRIGET ILLE MANVS.</b> <i>Manus</i> = <i>manum</i>; for the latter, compare
<i>Her</i> XVIII 15-16 'protinus haec scribens "felix i littera" dixi, / "iam
tibi formosam <i>porriget illa manum</i>"'. Alternatively, the phrase could
be taken to indicate Pompeius' gesture of welcoming to a suppliant: at
<i>Met</i> III 458 Narcissus, saying how he wished to embrace his reflection,
says 'cumque ego <i>porrexi tibi bracchia</i>, porrigis ultro'.</p>

<p><b>31-32. VIVIT ADHVC VITAMQVE TIBI DEBERE FATETVR, / QVAM PRIVS A MITI
CAESARE MVNVS HABET.</b> See on i 2 <i>debitor ... uitae</i>, and compare <i>Tr</i> V
ix 11-14 'Caesaris est primum munus, quod ducimus auras; / gratia post<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
magnos est tibi habenda deos. / ille dedit uitam; tu quam dedit ille
tueris, / et facis accepto munere posse frui': the similarity of
phrasing makes it all but certain that the poem was addressed to
Pompeius.</p>

<p><b>33. MEMORI ... ORE.</b> The phrase belongs to high poetic diction: compare
<i>Met</i> VI 508 'absentes pro se <i>memori</i> rogat <i>ore</i> salutent', <i>Met</i> X
204 (Apollo to the dead Hyacinthus) 'semper eris mecum <i>memorique</i>
haerebis in <i>ore</i>', and <i>AA</i> III 700 'auditos <i>memori</i> detulit <i>ore</i>
sonos'.</p>

<p><b>35. SANGVINE BISTONIVM QVOD NON TEPEFECERIT ENSEM.</b> Another instance of
high poetic diction: compare <i>Her</i> I 19 'sanguine Tlepolemus Lyciam
<i>tepefecerat</i> hastam', <i>Aen</i> IX 333-34 'atro <i>tepefacta</i> cruore /
terra', <i>Aen</i> IX 418-19 'hasta ... traiecto ... haesit <i>tepefacta</i>
cerebro', and Hor <i>Sat</i> II iii 136.</p>

<p><b>37-38. ADDITA PRAETEREA VITAE QVOQVE MVLTA TVENDAE / MVNERA.</b> The dative
expresses purpose. For the sense of <i>tueri</i> 'sustain', compare <i>Tr</i> V ix
13 'uitam ... quam dedit ille <i>tueris</i>', Cic <i>Deiot</i> 22 'atque antea
quidem maiores copias alere poterat; nunc exiguas uix <i>tueri</i> potest',
Livy V 4 5, XXIII 38 12 &amp; XXXIX 9 5, and Pliny <i>NH</i> XXXIII 134 'M.
Crassus negabat locupletem esse nisi qui reditu annuo legionem <i>tueri</i>
posset'.</p>

<p><b>38. NE PROPRIAS ATTENVARET OPES.</b> This may be a reference to the
financial burden of living in exile, but more probably refers to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
actual financial loss Ovid suffered in exile: 'ditata est spoliis
perfida turba meis' (<i>EP</i> II vii 62). It is clear from <i>Tr</i> I vi 7-8
that Ovid had feared such losses from the beginning of his exile.</p>

<p><i>Attenuare</i> is a very strong verb: compare <i>Met</i> VIII 843-45 (of
Erysichthon) 'iamque fame patrias altique uoragine uentris /
<i>attenuarat</i> ['had exhausted'&mdash;Miller] opes, sed inattenuata manebat /
tum quoque dira fames'.</p>

<p><b>39. PRO QVIBVS VT MERITIS REFERATVR GRATIA.</b> Similar language to Pompeius
at i 21 'et leuis haec <i>meritis referatur gratia</i> tantis'.</p>

<p><b>40. MANCIPII ... TVI</b> (<i>CB<sup>2</sup></i>) 'belonging to your property' seems a much
more elegant construction than the other manuscripts' MANCIPIVM ... TVVM
'your slave', and was conjectured by Heinsius; in support of <i>mancipium
... tuum</i> Burman cited viii 65-66 'si quid adhuc igitur uiui, Germanice,
nostro / restat in ingenio, <i>seruiet</i> omne tibi'.</p>

<p><b>41-44.</b> Ovid uses the common device of listing <i>adynata</i>; the second
version of the device at <i>Tr</i> I viii 1-10, where Ovid says that now his
friend has betrayed him he expects to see the <i>adynata</i> occur.
Comprehensive listings of <i>adynata</i> in ancient literature given by Smith
on Tib I iv 65-66, Shackleton Bailey on Prop I xv 29, Nisbet and Hubbard
on Hor <i>Carm</i> I ii 9, xxix 10 &amp; xxxiii 7, and by Gow on Theocritus I
132-36.</p>

<p><b>42. VELIVOLAS</b> occurs once more at xvi 21 'ueliuolique maris uates', and
nowhere else in Ovid's poetry. It is found at Lucretius V 1442 and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
<i>Aen</i> I 224 'mare ueliuolum', and was from old Latin poetry: Macrobius
(<i>Sat</i> VI v 10) cites instances from Livius Andronicus (Morel 58) and
Ennius (<i>Ann</i> 380 Vahlen<sup>3</sup>; <i>Andromache</i> 74 Ribbeck<sup>3</sup>).</p>

<p><b>43. SVPINO.</b> 'Backwards'; almost the reverse of <i>praeceps</i>. The same
sense at <i>Med Fac</i> 40 'nec redit in fontes unda <i>supina</i> suos'.</p>

<p><b>45. DIXERITIS.</b> See on 6 <i>transieritis</i>.</p>

<p><b>45. SVA DONA.</b> Compare <i>Her</i> XII 203 (Medea to Jason) 'dos mea tu sospes'
and Sen <i>Med</i> 142 'muneri parcat meo [=<i>uitae suae</i>]' &amp; 228-30.</p>

<p><b>46. SIC FVERIT VESTRAE CAVSA PERACTA VIAE.</b> 'So you will have carried out
the reason for your journey'. The same sense of <i>causa</i> at <i>Met</i> VI
449-50 'coeperat aduentus causam, mandata referre / coniugis' and of
<i>peragere</i> (always with <i>mandata</i> as object) at <i>Met</i> VII 502, XI 629 &amp;
XIV 460, <i>Fast</i> III 687, and <i>Tr</i> I i 35-36 'ut <i>peragas mandata</i>,
liber, culpabere forsan / ingeniique minor laude ferere mei'.</p>

<p>Professor E. Fantham points out to me that Ovid may here be playing on a
second sense of <i>causam peragere</i>, 'end a speech [in court]', for which
see <i>Met</i> XV 36-37 'spretarumque agitur legum reus ... <i>peracta</i> est /
causa prior ['the case for the prosecution'&mdash;Miller], crimenque patet'
and <i>Her</i> XXI 152.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VI_To_Brutus" id="VI_To_Brutus"></a>VI. To Brutus</h2>


<p>Of the Brutus to whom this poem is addressed nothing is known beyond
what Ovid here tells us. He was an advocate, by Ovid's testimony an
eminent one (29-38), and had been among the few who stood by Ovid at the
time of his exile (23-26). The collection of <i>Ex Ponto</i> I-III was
apparently dedicated to him, since the first poem of the first book and
the last poem of the third book are addressed to him, but the two poems
fail to give any further information on him or on his relationship to
Ovid.</p>

<p>Ovid starts the poem with the reflection that he has now spent five
years at Tomis (1-6). Fortune has tricked him: Fabius Maximus died
before he could appeal to Augustus, Augustus before he could pardon Ovid
(7-16). He hopes that the poem he has written on the apotheosis of
Augustus will win him pardon; Brutus' fine qualities guarantee that he
shares Ovid's wishes (17-22). The poem ends with a eulogy of Brutus'
character and an assurance of Ovid's eternal gratitude to those friends
who stood by him (23-50).</p>

<p><b>1. QVAM LEGIS.</b> See at ii 1 <i>quod legis</i> (<a href="#Page_162">p 162</a>).</p>

<p><b>3-4. SED TV QVOD NOLLES, VOLVIT MISERABILE FATVM; / EI MIHI, PLVS ILLVD
QVAM TVA VOTA VALET.</b> For the play on <i>nolle</i>/<i>uelle</i> and the thought of
4, compare <i>Met</i> IX 757-58 'quodque ego, <i>uult</i> genitor, <i>uult</i> ipsa
socerque futurus, / at <i>non uult</i> natura, potentior omnibus istis'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p><b>5. QVINQVENNIS.</b> Ovid often mentions the time he has spent in exile: see
<i>Tr</i> IV vi 19-20 (AD 10) 'ut patria careo, <i>bis</i> frugibus area trita
est, / dissiluit nudo pressa <i>bis</i> uua pede', <i>Tr</i> IV vii 1-2 '<i>Bis</i> me
sol adiit gelidae post frigora brumae, / <i>bisque</i> suum tacto Pisce
peregit iter', <i>Tr</i> V x 1-2 (AD 11-12) 'Vt sumus in Ponto, <i>ter</i> frigore
constitit Hister, / facta est Euxini dura <i>ter</i> unda maris', <i>EP</i> I ii
25-26 (AD 12-13) 'hic me pugnantem cum frigore cumque sagittis / cumque
meo fato <i>quarta</i> fatigat hiemps', <i>EP</i> I viii 27-28 'ut careo uobis,
Stygias detrusus in oras, / <i>quattuor</i> autumnos Pleias orta facit', <i>EP</i>
IV x 1 (AD 14) 'Haec mihi Cimmerio <i>bis tertia</i> ducitur aestas', and
<i>EP</i> IV xiii 39-40 'sed me iam, Care, niuali / <i>sexta</i> relegatum bruma
sub axe uidet'.</p>

<p>Ovid's first full year of exile was AD 9; since Augustus died on 19
August 14, this poem can be securely dated to the final few months of
that year.</p>

<p><b>5. OLYMPIAS</b> in Latin can mean a period of four or of five years; Ovid
may have used <i>quinquennis</i> to remove the ambiguity. <i>Olympias</i>
elsewhere in classical poetry apparently only at Manilius III 596, where
it also denotes a five-year period.</p>

<p><b>5-6. OLYMPIAS ACTA / IAM</b> <i>Housman</i> OLYMPIAS ACTA EST. / IAM <i>edd</i>. The
subject of <i>transit</i> must be <i>Olympias</i>, since otherwise the pentameter
is without a subject. Wheeler offers 'the time is now passing to a
second lustrum', which does not account for the genitive <i>lustri</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span><i>... alterius</i> (a second <i>tempus</i>, in the accusative, would have to be
understood), while Andr&eacute; gives 'et d&eacute;j&agrave; j'entre dans un second lustre',
which does not explain the person of <i>transit</i>. The editors' reading
could be retained, and <i>Olympias</i> understood as the subject of the
pentameter; but it seems simpler to follow Housman in omitting <i>est</i>
(with <i>L</i> and <i>T</i>) and joining the two lines in a single sentence.</p>

<p><i>Transit</i> is in strict terms illogical, since an Olympiad once completed
(<i>acta</i>) cannot pass into a second period of time, but the idiom seems
natural enough in view of Ovid's use of <i>transire</i> with seasons at <i>Met</i>
XV 206 '<i>transit in aestatem</i> post uer robustior annus'; compare as well
<i>Fast</i> V 185 (to Flora) 'incipis Aprili, <i>transis in tempora Maii</i>'.</p>

<p><b>7. PERSTAT ENIM FORTVNA TENAX.</b> In Ovid's case, Fortune does not show her
typical inconstancy.</p>

<p><b>8. OPPONIT NOSTRIS INSIDIOSA PEDEM.</b> Otto <i>pes</i> 7 cites this passage and
Petronius 57 10 'et habebam in domo qui mihi <i>pedem opponerent</i> hac
illac'.</p>

<p><b>9-10. CERTVS ERAS ... LOQVI.</b> 'You had made up your mind to speak'. The
same idiom at <i>Her</i> IV 151-52, <i>Her</i> VII 9 'certus es, Aenea, cum
foedere soluere naues ...?', <i>Met</i> IX 43, X 394 &amp; XI 440; the impersonal
construction at <i>Met</i> V 533, IX 53 'certum est mihi uera fateri' &amp; X
38-39.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p><b>9. FABIAE LAVS, MAXIME, GENTIS.</b> Similar phrasing at <i>EP</i> III iii 2 'o
sidus Fabiae, Maxime, gentis, ades'. This passage seems to be the
earliest instance of <i>laus</i> 'object of praise; reason for praise' used
of a person: <i>TLL</i> VII.2 1064 73 ff. cites from classical Latin only
<i>Eleg Maec</i> 17-18 'Pallade cum docta Phoebus donauerat artes; / tu decus
et <i>laudes</i> huius et huius eras', Valerius Flaccus II 243-44 'decus et
patriae <i>laus</i> una ruentis, / Hypsipyle', Silius XIII 824, and Martial I
xlix 2-3 'nostraeque <i>laus</i> Hispaniae ... Liciniane'. LVX (<i>F<sup>2</sup></i>), printed
by Burman, is acceptable enough (compare Cic <i>Cat</i> IV 11 'hanc urbem,
<i>lucem</i> orbis terrarum'), but is clearly a guess based on <i>F<sup>1</sup></i>'s DVX.</p>

<p>For a full discussion of the career of Paullus Fabius Maximus, <i>consul
ordinarius</i> in 11 BC, see Syme <i>HO</i> 135-55. He is the recipient of <i>EP</i>
I ii, a request to plead for Ovid with Augustus, and <i>EP</i> III iii, an
account of Ovid's vision of Amor which ends with a plea for Fabius'
assistance. He is prominently mentioned at Hor <i>Carm</i> IV i 9-12 as a
suitable prey for Venus, and it appears from Juvenal VII 94-95 that he
was a famous patron of literature: Ovid mentions his <i>scripta</i> at <i>EP</i> I
ii 135. We learn from the same poem that Ovid's wife was a member of
Fabius' family: 'ille ego de uestra cui data nupta domo est' (136).</p>

<p><b>10. SVPPLICE VOCE LOQVI.</b> Similar phrasing at <i>Met</i> VI 33 '<i>supplice
uoce</i> roga: ueniam dabit illa roganti'. The adjectival use of <i>supplex</i>
is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> not confined to verse; <i>OLD supplex</i> 2 cites instances from Caesar
and Suetonius.</p>

<p><b>11. OCCIDIS ANTE PRECES.</b> 'You died before making your request'. Since
Fabius is named in an inscription (<i>CIL</i> VI 2023a, line 17; cited by
Froesch 209) as having participated in the election of Drusus to the
Arval Brotherhood on 15 May AD 14, he must have died very shortly before
Augustus.</p>

<p><b>11-12. CAVSAMQVE EGO, MAXIME, MORTIS ... ME REOR ESSE TVAE.</b> The death of
Fabius, so soon before that of Augustus, seems to have raised popular
suspicions. Tacitus (<i>Ann</i> I 5 1-2) mentions a rumour that Fabius had
secretly accompanied Augustus to Planasia to visit Agrippa Postumus and
that his wife had warned Livia of this; Augustus heard of this, and at
Fabius' funeral she was heard blaming herself for his death. If Fabius'
death occurred under strange circumstances, Ovid's accusation against
himself of having been its cause may have special point.</p>

<p>For a full discussion of the circumstances of Fabius' death, see Syme

instances from Propertius, who seems to have been fondest of the idiom,
and only one certain instance from Tibullus, II v 79 'haec fuerant
olim'.</p>

<p>FVERO (<i>BC</i>) gives the sense 'but I will be discovered not to have been
worth this much'; the tense seems difficult to fit to the context.</p>

<p>FVERIM (<i>British Library Burney 220, saec xii-xiii</i>) 'but I hope I was
not worth so much' is quite possibly correct, and would account for the
corruption to <i>fuero</i>.</p>

<p><b>12. NEC ... TANTI.</b> Similar phrasing at <i>Met</i> X 613 (Atalanta ponders
Hippomenes' willingness to risk death to gain her hand) '<i>non</i> sum me
iudice <i>tanti</i>'.</p>

<p><b>13. MANDARE.</b> 'Consign'; a legal term for charging others with carrying
out business on one's behalf, which carried certain obligations with it.
See Gaius III 155-62, Just <i>Inst</i> III 26, and the discussion at Buckland
514-21.</p>

<p><b>15. DETECTAE ... CVLPAE</b> <i>scripsi</i> DECEPTAE ... CVLPAE <i>codd</i>. <i>Me decipit
error</i> is a phrase used by Ovid to mean 'I am making a mistake'; see
<i>EP</i> III ix 9-12 'auctor opus laudat ... iudicium tamen hic non <i>decipit
error</i> ['I do not make this error of judgment'], / nec quicquid genui
protinus illud amo'. Ovid uses the expression very often for the
"mistake" which led to his exile: see <i>Tr</i> I iii 37-38 (Ovid to his
friends on the night of his exile) 'caelestique uiro quis me <i>deceperit
error</i> / dicite pro culpa ne scelus esse putet', <i>Tr</i> IV i 23 'scit
quoque [<i>sc</i> Musa]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> cum perii quis me <i>deceperit error</i>', and <i>EP</i> II ii
61 'quasi me nullus <i>deceperit error</i>'. He uses <i>decipere</i> once when
speaking of the other cause of his exile: 'o puer [<i>sc</i> Amor], exilii
<i>decepto</i> causa magistro' (<i>EP</i> III iii 23). Wheeler took <i>deceptae</i> to
refer to Ovid: 'Augustus had begun to pardon the fault I committed in
error'. This kind of extreme hypallage, with the true modified noun not
expressed, does not however seem to be Ovid's practice, although found
in the Silver poets: Statius <i>Theb</i> IX 425 'deceptaque fulmina' means
'the thunderbolts thrown by Jupiter at the request of Semele, who had
been <i>deceived</i> by Juno'. Professor J. N. Grant suggests DECEPTI to me;
but the genitive of the first person is rare in Ovid, and the perfect
participle without expressed noun seems difficult. Owen saw the
difficulty with <i>deceptae</i>, and in his second edition referred to Livy
XXII 4 4 'id tantum hostium quod ex aduerso erat conspexit; ab tergo ac
super caput <i>deceptae</i> insidiae'. But <i>deceptae</i> (which has been
variously emended) there means <i>occultae</i>, as explained by Housman
(521-22), who cited Prop II xxiv 35-36 'Phrygio fallax Maeandria campo /
errat et ipsa suas <i>decipit</i> unda uias' and Sen <i>HF</i> 155 for the same
sense; and <i>occultae</i> is clearly not the meaning here required, since
Ovid's misdemeanour was all too visible.</p>

<p>Being unable to explain <i>deceptae</i>, I have conjectured <i>detectae</i>. Ovid
seems to have committed his <i>error</i> in two stages. First he committed
the original misdemeanour; then he kept silent about it when it might
have been better for him to speak. Compare <i>Tr</i> III vi 11-13<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> 'cuique
ego narrabam secreti quicquid habebam, / excepto quod me perdidit, unus
eras. / id quoque si scisses, saluo fruerere sodali'. Later this
misdemeanour was discovered: for the arrival of the news of this
discovery when Ovid was visiting Elba with Cotta Maximus, see <i>EP</i> II
iii 83-90. It is to this discovery that <i>detectae</i> refers: 'Augustus had
begun to forgive the misdemeanour that had been revealed'. For this use
of <i>detegere</i> compare <i>Met</i> II 544-47 'ales / sensit adulterium
Phoebeius [<i>coruus</i>, the raven], utque latentem / <i>detegeret culpam</i>,
non exorabilis index, / ad dominum tendebat iter' and Livy XXII 28 8
'necubi ... motus alicuius ... aut fulgor armorum fraudem ... detegeret'.</p>

<p>Professor R. J. Tarrant points out to me the parallel problem at <i>Met</i>
IX 711 'indecepta pia mendacia fraude latebant', where context requires
<i>indecepta</i> to have the meaning 'undetected'. <i>Indecepta</i> might be taken
to support <i>deceptae</i> in the present passage, but I am more inclined to
read <i>indetecta</i> for <i>indecepta</i>: of the various conjectures made,
Zingerle's <i>inde incepta</i> is most commonly accepted.</p>

<p>At <i>Her</i> IX 101-2 'tolle procul, <i>decepte</i>, faces, Hymenaee, maritas /
et fuge turbato tecta nefanda pede!', <i>detecte</i> should similarly be
read. <i>Detecte</i> better explains why Hymenaeus should flee; also,
Hymenaeus has not been deceived, for it appears from 61-62 'spes bona
det uires; fratris [<i>Palmer</i>: fratri <i>codd</i>] nam nupta futura es; /
illius de quo mater, et uxor eris' that Macareus had fully intended to
marry Canace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p><b>16. SPEM NOSTRAM TERRAS DESERVITQVE SIMVL.</b> The <i>-que</i> should of course
be taken with <i>terras</i>.</p>

<p>This is a typical instance of Ovid's love of <i>syllepsis</i>, of giving a
single verb two objects (or more), each of which uses a different
meaning of the verb. Compare, from many instances, ix 90 'nec cum
fortuna mens quoque uersa mea est', <i>Her</i> VII 9 'certus es, Aenea, cum
foedere soluere naues', <i>Met</i> II 601-2 'et pariter uultusque deo
plectrumque colorque / excidit', <i>Met</i> VIII 177, <i>Fast</i> III 225, <i>Fast</i>
III 857 'hic [the messenger of Ino] ... corruptus cum semine', <i>Fast</i> V
652 'montibus his ponunt spemque laremque suum', and <i>EP</i> II vii 84
'meque simul serua iudiciumque tuum'.</p>

<p><b>16. DESERVITQVE.</b> Ovid does not use <i>deserere</i> with things as object
until his poetry of exile: compare <i>Tr</i> I ix 65 'nec amici <i>desere</i>
causam'. Instances in the later <i>Heroides</i> at XV 155 'Sappho <i>desertos</i>
cantat amores' and XVI 260 'orantis medias <i>deseruere</i> preces'; in both
cases the objects are virtually equivalent to persons.</p>

<p><b>17. TAMEN.</b> 'In spite of my dejection'.</p>

<p><b>17-18. DE CAELITE ... RECENTI ... CARMEN.</b> The poem does not survive. At
xiii 25-32 Ovid describes a similar poem on the apotheosis of Augustus,
written in Getic.</p>

<p><b>17. RECENTI.</b> 'New, freshly created'. Used in similar contexts at <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span><i>Met</i>
IV 434-35 'umbraeque <i>recentes</i> ... simulacraque functa sepulcris', VIII
488 'fraterni manes animaeque <i>recentes</i>', X 48-49 'Eurydicenque uocant:
umbras erat illa <i>recentes</i> / inter', and especially XV 844-46 'Venus
... Caesaris eripuit membris nec in aera solui / passa <i>recentem</i> animam
caelestibus intulit astris'.</p>

<p><b>18. VESTRA</b> = 'of you [plural] at Rome'.</p>

<p><b>18. CARMEN IN ORA DEDI.</b> 'I sent a poem for you to recite from and speak
of'. <i>Dare</i> meaning 'send' is usually restricted to use with <i>litteras</i>
(<i>OLD do</i> 10; compare Cic <i>Att</i> II i 12 &amp; IX viiB 1, Livy XXVII 16 13).</p>

<p>For <i>in ora</i>, compare Catullus XL 5 'an ut peruenias <i>in ora</i> uulgi
[<i>sc</i> hoc facis]?', Hor <i>Ep</i> I iii 9 '... Titius, Romana breui uenturus
<i>in ora</i>', Prop III ix 32 (to Maecenas) 'et uenies tu quoque <i>in ora</i>
uirum', <i>Tr</i> V vii 29-30 'non tamen ingratum est quodcumque obliuia
nostri / impedit et profugi nomen <i>in ora</i> refert', and Livy II 36 3.
The only instance I have found of the expression being used of a thing
rather than a person other than this passage is also from Ovid: 'illud
opus ... nunc incorrectum populi peruenit <i>in ora</i>, / in populi quicquam
si tamen ore mei est' (<i>Tr</i> III xiv 21-24). Neither passage would have
seemed strange to the Romans, given the close identification between
poet and work: compare Ennius' famous 'uolito uiuo' per ora uirum' and
<i>Met</i> XV 878 'ore legar populi'.</p>

<p><b>19. QVAE PIETAS.</b> 'This demonstration of loyalty'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p><b>20. SACRAE ... DOMVS.</b> Augustus' house called 'magni ... Iouis ... domum' at
<i>Tr</i> III i 38; compare as well <i>EP</i> III i 135 'domus Augusti, Capitoli
more colenda'.</p>

<p><b>20. MITIOR IRA.</b> Compare <i>EP</i> III iii 83 'pone metus igitur: <i>mitescet</i>
Caesaris <i>ira</i>'.</p>

<p><b>21. LIQVIDO POSSVM IVRARE.</b> 'I can swear unambiguously'. The only other
instance of this sense in verse apparently III iii 49-50 'scis tamen et
<i>liquido</i> iuratus dicere possis / non me legitimos sollicitasse toros'.
From prose compare Cic <i>II Verr</i> IV 124 'confirmare hoc <i>liquido</i>,
iudices, possum, ualuas magnificentiores ... nullas umquam ullo in templo
fuisse', <i>II Verr</i> III 136, <i>Fam</i> XI 27 7 'alia sunt quae <i>liquido</i>
negare soleam', and Sen <i>Ben</i> VII 9 5.</p>

<p><b>22. NON DVBIA ... NOTA.</b> The phrase logically belongs with the preceding
line: on the firm evidence of Brutus' past behaviour (described in
23-42), Ovid can confidently state that Brutus prays for his
restoration. <i>Non dubia</i> by litotes for <i>certa</i> (for which see <i>Her</i> XX
207 'te ... nimium miror, <i>nota certa</i> furoris'); <i>nota</i> 'tangible sign,
evidence' similarly used at <i>Met</i> I 761 (<i>generis</i>). FIDE (<i>LTM<sup>2ul</sup>F<sup>2ul</sup></i>)
is an obvious gloss for <i>nota</i>.</p>

<p><b>23. VERVM ... AMOREM.</b> 'Sincere love' (Wheeler); compare <i>Met</i> V 61
'<i>ueri</i> non dissimulator <i>amoris'</i> and <i>Tr</i> IV iv 71 'et comes exemplum
<i>ueri</i> Phoceus <i>amoris</i>'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p><b>25. TVAS ... LACRIMAS NOSTRASQVE.</b> The tears of Ovid's friends at his
departure described at <i>Tr</i> III iv 39-40, <i>EP</i> I ix 17-18, and <i>EP</i> II
xi 9-10 (to Rufus) 'grande uoco lacrimas meritum quibus ora rigabas, /
cum mea concreto sicca dolore forent'.</p>

<p><b>26. PASSVROS POENAM CREDERET ESSE DVOS.</b> Compare <i>Tr</i> V iv 37-38 (Ovid's
letter speaking) 'quamuis attonitus, sensit tamen omnia, <i>nec te / se
minus aduersis indoluisse suis</i>'.</p>

<p><b>27. LENEM TE MISERIS GENVIT NATURA.</b> Compare Cic <i>Tusc</i> II 11 'te
<i>natura</i> excelsum quendam uidelicet et altum et humana despicientem
<i>genuit</i>' and Ennius <i>Ann</i> 112 Vahlen<sup>3</sup> (of Romulus) 'qualem te patriae
custodem di <i>genuerunt</i>'.</p>

<p><b>29. MARTE FORENSI.</b> Similar metaphor for the lawcourts at <i>Fast</i> IV 188
'et fora <i>Marte suo</i> litigiosa uacent', <i>Tr</i> III xii 17-18 'ludis /
cedunt uerbosi garrula <i>bella</i> fori' and <i>Tr</i> IV x 17-18 'frater
... fortia uerbosi natus ad <i>arma</i> fori'. According to Ovid real wounds
were suffered in the forum at Tomis: 'adde quod iniustum rigido ius
dicitur ense, / dantur et in medio uulnera saepe foro' (<i>Tr</i> V x 43-44).</p>

<p><b>30. POSSE TVO PERAGI VIX PVTET ORE REOS.</b> Similar language at <i>Tr</i> I i
23-24 'protinus admonitus repetet mea crimina lector, / <i>et peragar
populi publicus ore reus</i>'. <i>Peragere</i> refers to the prosecution of a
defendant carried to its end, but does not imply success for the
prosecutor: see Pliny <i>Ep</i> III ix 30 and Ulpian <i>Dig</i> XLVIII v 2 1<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> 'non
alias ad mulierem possit peruenire, nisi reum peregerit [<i>sc</i>
adulterii]; peregisse autem non alias quis uidetur, <i>nisi et
condemnauerit</i>'.</p>

<p><b>31. QVAMVIS PVGNARE VIDENTVR</b> <i>BMFH</i>. Given the dependent <i>pugnare</i>, it
seems hardly possible to read the VIDETVR given by the other
manuscripts. The same problem arises at <i>Met</i> VIII 463-64 '<i>pugnant</i>
materque sororque, / et diuersa trahunt unum duo nomina pectus', where
the manuscripts divide between <i>pugnant</i> and <i>pugnat</i>; for an
unambiguous parallel, see <i>Her</i> XIX 173 'nunc, male res iunctae, calor
et reuerentia <i>pugnant</i>'.</p>

<p>Heinsius further suggested deleting <i>est</i> from the preceding <i>scilicet
eiusdem est</i> 'cum tribus libris', but the change in number does not seem
unduly harsh.</p>

<p><b>32. SVPPLICIBVS FACILEM.</b> See on iv 30 <i>faciles in tua uota</i>, and compare
<i>Am</i> II iii 5-6 (to his girl's eunuch) 'mollis in obsequium <i>facilisque
rogantibus</i> esses, / si tuus in quauis praetepuisset amor' and <i>Her</i> XVI
197-98 'da modo te <i>facilem</i>, nec dedignare maritum ... Phrygem'.</p>

<p>Ovid is here indirectly referring to his own situation: compare <i>EP</i> III
iii 107-8 'at tua <i>supplicibus</i> domus est adsueta <i>iuuandis</i>, / <i>in
quorum numero me precor esse uelis</i>'.</p>

<p><b>33. LEGIS VINDICTA.</b> 'The exacting of punishment on behalf of the law'.
The law has been broken, and therefore demands retribution; Brutus acts
on its behalf. For the sense of the genitive compare Val Max I 1 ext 3:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
(Dionysius of Syracuse committed many acts of sacrilege, but punishment
was visited on him after his death in the form of his son's ignominious
career) 'lento enim gradu ad <i>uindictam sui</i> diuina procedit ira
tarditatemque supplicii grauitate pensat'.</p>

<p><b>33. LEGIS ... SEVERAE.</b> <i>Seuerae</i> here serves as a standard epithet and
has no such special force as at <i>EP</i> III iii 57-58 'uetiti ... <i>lege
seuera</i> / credor adulterii composuisse notas'.</p>

<p><b>34. VERBA VELVT TAETRVM SINGVLA VIRVS HABENT.</b> The same image at <i>EP</i> III
iii 105-6 'ergo alii noceant miseris optentque timeri, / <i>tinctaque
mordaci spicula felle gerant</i>'.</p>

<p><b>34. TAETRVM</b> <i>R. J. Tarrant</i> TINCTV <i>Ehwald</i> TINCTVM <i>codd</i>. <i>Tinctum</i> is
impossible: if the word were used, it would have to go with <i>uerba</i>.
Compare <i>Ibis</i> 53-54 'liber iambus / <i>tincta</i> Lycambeo sanguine <i>tela</i>
dabit', <i>Ibis</i> 491 '[tamque cadas domitus ...] quam qui <i>dona</i> tulit
Nesseo <i>tincta</i> ueneno', <i>EP</i> III i 26 <i>'tinctaque</i> mortifera tabe
<i>sagitta</i> madet', and <i>EP</i> III iii 106 <i>'tinctaque</i> mordaci <i>spicula</i>
felle gerant'. Ehwald's <i>tinctu</i> is linguistically and palaeographically
somewhat better than Merkel's <i>tinguat</i>: for similar corruptions compare
<i>Fast</i> III 612 'flet tamen <i>admonitu</i> motus, Elissa, tui', where many
manuscripts read <i>admonitus</i>, and <i>Tr</i> I iv 9 'pinea texta sonant pulsu
[<i>Rothmaler</i>: pulsi <i>codd</i>], stridore rudentes'. Even so, 'Each of your
words carries poison, as though it had been dipped in it' seems awkward.
For Professor Tarrant's <i>taetrum</i> compare Lucretius I 936<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> 'absinthia
taetra', <i>Dirae</i> 23 'taetra uenena', and <i>Hal</i> 131 'nigrum ... uirus'.</p>

<p><b>34. VIRVS HABENT.</b> Compare <i>Tr</i> IV i 84 'aut telo <i>uirus habente</i> perit'
&amp; III x 64 'nam uolucri ferro tinctile <i>uirus inest</i>'.</p>

<p><b>35-36. HOSTIBVS EVENIAT QUAM SIS VIOLENTVS IN ARMIS / SENTIRE.</b> <i>Hostibus
eueniat</i> is a common phrase in Ovid: compare <i>Am</i> II x 16-17 '<i>hostibus
eueniat</i> uita seuera meis! / <i>hostibus eueniat</i> uiduo dormire cubili',
<i>Am</i> III xi 16, <i>AA</i> III 247, <i>Fast</i> III 493-94 'at, puto, praeposita
est fuscae mihi Candida paelex! / <i>eueniat nostris hostibus</i> ille dolor
[<i>recc quidam</i>: color <i>codd plerique</i>]!', and <i>Her</i> XVI 219-20 (Paris to
Helen) '<i>hostibus eueniant</i> conuiuia talia nostris, / experior posito
qualia saepe mero!'.</p>

<p><b>37. QVAE TIBI TAM TENVI CVRA LIMANTVR.</b> 'Which are sharpened by you with
such painstaking care'. For this meaning of <i>limare</i> compare Pliny <i>NH</i>
VIII 71 'cornu ad saxa <i>limato</i>' and Cic <i>Brut</i> 236 '[M. Piso ...]
habuit a natura genus quoddam <i>acuminis</i>, quod etiam arte <i>limauerat</i>'.</p>

<p><b>37-38. VT OMNES / ISTIVS INGENVI PECTORIS ESSE NEGENT.</b> 'So that all
would deny that they are the product of your kindly spirit'; for this
sense of <i>ingenuus</i> compare Catullus LXVIII 37-38 'quod cum ita sit,
nolim statuas nos mente maligna / id facere aut <i>animo</i> non satis
<i>ingenuo</i>'. <i>Ingenui pectoris</i> is my correction for the manuscripts'
INGENIVM CORPORIS, which could only mean 'so that all would deny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> that
the talent of your body exists'; Ovid can hardly be identifying the
<i>tela</i> of 36 with Brutus' <i>ingenium</i>. Wheeler translates 'On these [the
missiles of your tongue] you use the file with such extreme care that
none would recognize in them your real nature', and Andr&eacute; 'que personne
ne croirait qu'un tel esprit habite ton corps'; neither translation fits
the Latin. Shackleton Bailey's INGENIVM NOMINIS still leaves unsolved
the problem of <i>ingenium</i>.</p>

<p>
The corruption of <i>ingenui</i> to <i>ingenium</i> (or rather,
<i>ingeni&#363;</i>) is simple enough;
and the interchange of <i>pectus</i> and <i>corpus</i> is a common error.</p>

<p><b>42. NOTITIAM ... INFITIATA.</b> <i>Infitiari</i> used similarly at <i>EP</i> I vii 27
'nec tuus est genitor nos <i>infitiatus</i> amicos'.</p>

<p><b>43. IMMEMOR ... IMMEMOR.</b> Professor R. J. Tarrant points out the similar
epanalepsis at Hor <i>Ep</i> I xi 9 '<i>oblitusque</i> meorum, <i>obliuiscendus</i> et
illis'.</p>

<p><b>44. SOLLICITI</b> <i>BCM<sup>2ul</sup></i> SOLLICITE <i>M<sup>1</sup>FHILT</i>. The adjective with adverbial
meaning would be especially liable to corruption. The same construction
at <i>Am</i> II iv 25 'dulce canit flectitque <i>facillima</i> uocem'.</p>

<p><b>44. LEVASTIS</b> <i>Barberinus lat. 26, saec xiii</i> LEVATIS <i>BCMFHILT</i>. If 44
were taken in isolation, <i>leuatis</i>, which most editors print, would be
acceptable enough; compare <i>Tr</i> IV i 49 ' iure deas igitur ueneror mala
nostra <i>leuantes</i>' and <i>EP</i> III vi 13-14 'nec scelus admittas si
consoleris amicum, / mollibus et uerbis aspera fata <i>leues</i>'. But it is
clear from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> 42 'est infitiata' and 49 'doluistis' that Ovid is speaking
of the time of his banishment, and so <i>leuastis</i> must be read. Compare
<i>Tr</i> I v 75 'me deus oppressit, nullo <i>mala nostra leuante</i>', <i>EP</i> II
vii 61-62 'recta fides comitum poterat <i>mala nostra leuare</i>: / ditata
est spoliis perfida turba meis', and <i>EP</i> III ii 25-26 'pars estis pauci
melior, qui rebus in artis / ferre mihi nullam turpe putastis [<i>uar</i>
putatis] opem'.</p>

<p><b>45-50.</b> Compare the listing of <i>adynata</i> at the end of v (41-44), which
again illustrates Ovid's eternal gratitude (to Sextus Pompeius). Here
the personal detail (<i>hic nimium nobis conterminus Hister</i>) makes the
<i>adynaton</i> reflect Ovid's own circumstances.</p>

<p><b>46. DE MARE.</b> The same form of the ablative at <i>Tr</i> V ii 20 'pleno de
mare'. Compare Ovid's frequent use of the metrically convenient ablative
in <i>-e</i> of third-declension adjectives.</p>

<p><b>47-48.</b> Thyestes' feast cited as a proverbial example at <i>Met</i> XV 62
(Pythagoras is urging a vegetarian diet) 'neue Thyesteis cumulemus
uiscera mensis', <i>Tr</i> II 391-92 'si non Aeropen [<i>Politianus</i>: Meropen
<i>uel</i> Europen <i>codd</i>] frater sceleratus amasset, / auersos Solis non
legeremus equos', Lucan I 534-44, and Martial III xlv 1-2 'Fugerit an
Phoebus mensas cenamque Thyestae / ignoro: fugimus nos, Ligurine, tuam'.</p>

<p><b>47. VTQVE ... SI</b> = <i>et, quasi</i>. All of the instances of the idiom cited
by Lewis &amp; Short <i>ut</i> II A 2e and <i>OLD ut</i> 8d are from prose, except for
Ter <i>Eun</i> 117 and Lucilius 330 Marx. In none of these passages is <i>ut</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
separated from <i>si</i>: the hyperbaton elevates the phrase and makes more
natural its use in verse.</p>

<p><b>49. QVI ME DOLVISTIS ADEMPTVM.</b> 'Who mourned my exile' is the meaning
imposed by context, but the phrase would usually mean 'who mourned my
death': compare <i>EP</i> I ix 41 'iure igitur lacrimas Celso libamus
<i>adempto</i>', and the similar use of <i>raptus</i> for the exiled Ovid at xi 5
and xvi 1. For Ovid's considering his exile as his death, see xvi 1-4,
<i>Tr</i> III iii 53 'cum patriam amisi, tunc me periisse putato', and <i>EP</i> I

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VII_To_Vestalis" id="VII_To_Vestalis"></a>VII. To Vestalis</h2>


<p>Vestalis, a younger son of Cottius, monarch of a small kingdom in the
Alps (see at 29 [<a href="#Page_253">p 253</a>]), was <i>primipilaris</i> of the legion of the area
(perhaps the <i>V Macedonica</i>). He had just been named administrator of
the region around Tomis (see at 1); as an important local official, he
was a natural choice as recipient of one of Ovid's letters.</p>

<p>The poem starts with a description of the harsh climate of Tomis, to
which Vestalis along with Ovid can now testify, and of the savagery of
the inhabitants (1-12). This serves as a bridge to a compliment to
Vestalis on being named <i>primipilaris</i> (13-18), and to the main body of
the poem, a long and rather conventional description of how Vestalis led
the final attack in the recovery of Aegissos (19-52). In the concluding
distich Ovid declares that he has rendered immortal the deeds of
Vestalis.</p>

<p><b>1. ORAS</b> (<i>CI</i>) seems more suited to the nature of Vestalis' command than
VNDAS, the reading of the other manuscripts. After <i>Euxinas</i>, corruption
from <i>oras</i> to <i>undas</i> would be very easy, the inverse less so. Ovid
does not elsewhere use <i>Euxinae orae</i>, the usual substantives with
<i>Euxinus</i> being <i>aquae</i>, <i>mare</i>, <i>fretum</i>, and, closest in meaning,
<i>litus</i>, for which see iii 51 'litus ad Euxinum ... ibis', <i>Tr</i> V ii
63-64 'iussus ad Euxini deformia litora ueni / aequoris', and <i>Tr</i> V iv
1.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p><b>2. POSITIS ... SVB AXE</b> in effect acts as a single adjective meaning
'northern'; <i>axe</i> plays a subordinate role and so does not require an
epithet. The phrasing may be based on Accius 566-67 Ribbeck<sup>2</sup> '[ora ...]
<i>sub axe posita</i> ad Stellas septem, unde horrifer / Aquilonis stridor
gelidas molitur niues'. <i>Lycaonio ... sub axe</i> at <i>Tr</i> III ii 2.</p>

<p><b>3. ASPICIS EN PRAESENS.</b> Compare ix 81-86, where Ovid invites Graecinus
to ask his brother Flaccus, recently stationed in the Pontus, about
conditions of life in the area.</p>

<p><b>3. IACEAMVS.</b> 'Lie suffering': similarly used at <i>EP</i> I iii 49 'orbis in
extremi <i>iaceo</i> desertus harenis', I vii 5, II ix 4 &amp; III i 85 'ut minus
infesta <i>iaceam</i> regione labora'.</p>

<p><b>4. FALSA ... QVERI.</b> Perhaps a common phrase: Professor R. J. Tarrant
cites Sallust <i>Iug</i> 1 '<i>Falso queritur</i> de natura sua genus humanum'.</p>

<p><b>5-6. ACCEDET ... FIDES.</b> 'People will believe'. Compare Cic <i>Diu</i> I 5
'Cratippusque ... isdem rebus <i>fidem tribuit</i>, reliqua diuinationis
genera reiecit' and Tac <i>Germ</i> 3 4 'ex ingenio quisque <i>demat uel addat
fidem</i>' 'each can believe or disbelieve this according to his
disposition'.</p>

<p><b>5-6. NON IRRITA ... FIDES</b> = <i>rata fides</i>, a phrase meaning
'trustworthiness', <i>rata</i> having no special force. Compare <i>Met</i> III 341
'prima <i>fide</i> [genitive] ... <i>ratae</i> temptamina', <i>Tr</i> I v 49-50 'multa
credibili tulimus <i>ratamque</i>, / quamuis acciderint, non habitura
<i>fidem</i>', and <i>Tr</i> III x 35-36<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> 'cum sint praemia falsi / nulla, <i>ratam</i>
debet testis habere <i>fidem</i>'. Note the hyperbaton in all these passages.</p>

<p><b>6. ALPINIS IVVENIS REGIBVS ORTE.</b> See at 29 <i>progenies alti fortissima
Donni</i> (<a href="#Page_253">p 253</a>). For the language, compare Hor <i>Carm</i> I i 1 'Maecenas
atauis edite regibus'.</p>

<p><b>7. IPSE VIDES CERTE GLACIE CONCRESCERE PONTVM.</b> At ix 85-86 Ovid tells
Graecinus to ask his brother Flaccus 'mentiar, an coeat duratus frigore
Pontus, / et teneat glacies iugera multa freti'.</p>

<p>Similar language at <i>Tr</i> III x 37-38 'uidimus ingentem glacie consistere
pontum, / lubricaque [<i>codd</i>: lubrica cum <i>fort scribendum</i>] immotas
testa premebat aquas'.</p>

<p><b>8. IPSE VIDES RIGIDO STANTIA VINA GELV.</b> The same picture more explicitly
given at <i>Tr</i> III x 23-24 'nudaque consistunt, formam seruantia testae,
/ uina, nec hausta meri, sed data frusta bibunt'.</p>

<p><b>9-10. IPSE VIDES ONERATA FEROX VT DVCAT IAZYX / PER MEDIAS HISTRI

barbara plaustra boues</i>' and <i>Tr</i> III xii 29-30 'nec mare concrescit
glacie, nec ut ante per Histrum / stridula Sauromates <i>plaustra
bubulcus</i> agit'.</p>

<p><b>9. IAZYX.</b> The <i>Iazyges Sarmatae</i> are mentioned by Pliny (<i>NH</i> IV 80) and
by Strabo (VII 3 17), who describes them as one of several tribes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
living between the Borysthenes (Dnepr) and the Danube. They are also
listed by Pompey, under the name of 'Iazyges Metanastae', the Wandering
Iazyges (<i>Geog</i> III 7); the 'Iazyges' he describes as living along the
shore of the Maeotis (III 5 19). Tacitus mentions the nation at <i>Ann</i>
XII 29 4 (Vannius, king of the Suebi, is under attack) 'ipsi manus
propria pedites, eques e Sarmaticis Iazygibus erat' and at <i>Hist</i> III 5
(the <i>principes Sarmatarum Iazygum</i> are enlisted to ensure the defence
of Moesia in the absence of the regular troops; their offer to raise
infantry as well as supplying their usual force of cavalry is rejected
because of the fear of future treachery).</p>

<p>The name of the tribe was difficult metrically, so here Ovid calls them
<i>Iazyges</i>, while at <i>Tr</i> III xii 30 (cited in the previous note) he
calls them <i>Sauromatae</i>. At <i>EP</i> I ii 77 he solves the difficulty
through hendiadys: 'quid <i>Sauromatae</i> faciant, quid <i>Iazyges</i> acres'.</p>

<p><b>11. ASPICIS.</b> Ovid here uses verbs of seeing in an interesting way. At 7
and 9 he has <i>uides</i>; then <i>aspicis</i> suggests continuity but at the same
time movement toward a new subject, and with a military detail
introduced so as to introduce Vestalis' experience of war; then in 13-14
the emphasis is changed by the contrary-to-fact past optative <i>utinam
... spectata fuisset</i>.</p>

<p><b>11. ASPICIS ET MITTI SVB ADVNCO TOXICA FERRO.</b> 'You behold how poison is
hurled on the barbed steel' (Wheeler). The <i>telum</i> of 12 should be taken
to be a spear, since <i>mittere</i> never seems to be used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> of arrows. At
<i>Ibis</i> 135 the <i>hasta</i> is mentioned as the special weapon of the
Iazyges.</p>

<p><b>11. ADVNCO.</b> The spear had hooks. Compare <i>Met</i> VI 252-53 'quod [<i>sc</i>
ferrum] simul eductum est, pars et pulmonis <i>in hamis</i> / eruta cumque
anima cruor est effusus in auras', where B&ouml;mer cites among other
passages Curtius IX 5 23 'corpore ... nudato animaduertunt <i>hamos inesse
telo</i> nec aliter id sine pernicie corporis extrahi posse quam ut secando
uulnus augerent' and Prop II xii 9 'et merito <i>hamatis</i> manus est armata
sagittis'.</p>

<p><b>13-14. ATQVE VTINAM PARS HAEC TANTUM SPECTATA FVISSET, / NON ETIAM
PROPRIO COGNITA MARTE TIBI.</b> A similar opposition at <i>Met</i> III 247-48 (of
Actaeon) <i>'uelletque uidere, / non etiam sentire</i> canum fera facta
suorum'.</p>

<p><b>15. TENDITVR</b> <i>Owen</i> TENDITIS <i>codd</i>. The number of <i>tenditis</i> is
inappropriate to the context. Owen's <i>tenditur</i>, independently
conjectured two years later by Ehwald (<i>KB</i> 84), seems a somewhat more
elegant solution to the problem than Merkel's TENDISTI. It puts the
weight of the line on <i>ad primum ... pilum</i> rather than on Vestalis
himself; the pentameter, with its emphasis on the <i>honor</i>, suggests that
this is right.</p>

<p><b>15. PRIMVM PILVM.</b> Compare <i>Am</i> III viii 27-28 'proque bono uersu
<i>primum</i> deducite <i>pilum</i>! / nox [<i>A. Y. Campbell</i>: hoc <i>uel</i> hic
<i>codd</i>] tibi, si<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> belles [<i>Madvig</i>: uelles <i>codd</i>], possit, Homere,
dari'. The <i>primipilaris</i> was the commander of the first century of the
first cohort of the Roman legion, and hence first in rank among the
legion's centurions.</p>

<p><b>17. PLENIS</b> is the reading of all but two of the manuscripts collated.
For this sense of <i>plenus</i> ('abundant'), compare <i>Am</i> I viii 56 '<i>plena</i>
uenit canis de grege praeda lupis', <i>Nux</i> 91-92 'illa [the tree that is
not near a road] suo quaecumque tulit dare dona colono / et <i>plenos</i>
fructus adnumerare potest', Hor <i>Sat</i> I i 57, and Cic <i>Sex Rosc</i> 6
'alienam pecuniam tam <i>plenam</i> atque praeclaram'. Ehwald read PLENVS
(<i>F<sup>ac</sup>I</i>), joining <i>ingens</i> with <i>uirtus</i> in the following line, arguing
that the honour would not seem a great one to a member of a royal
family. But Ovid devoted four lines to describing Vestalis' new rank: he
must have believed that Vestalis would consider it a very great honour
indeed. As well, if <i>ingens</i> is connected with <i>titulus</i>, <i>uirtus
... maior</i> gains point.</p>

<p><b>17. PLENIS ... FRVCTIBVS.</b> For the wealth of the <i>primipilaris</i>, see <i>Am</i>
III viii 9-10 'ecce recens diues parto per uulnera censu / praefertur
nobis sanguine pastus eques'. In that poem the newly-rich
<i>primipilaris</i>, Ovid's rival in love, is given a character very
different from that of Vestalis.</p>

<p><b>17. INGENS</b> is used at ix 65 of another office, the consulship.</p>

<p><b>18. IPSA TAMEN VIRTVS ORDINE MAIOR ERIT.</b> A similar sentiment at <i>EP</i> II
ix 11-14 (to king Cotys) 'regia, crede mihi, res est succurrere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> lapsis
... fortunam decet hoc istam ['this befits your position'], <i>quae maxima
cum sit, / esse potest animo uix tamen aequa tuo</i>'.</p>

<p><b>19. NON NEGAT HOC HISTER.</b> For the device of calling to witness the
scenes of military exploits compare Catullus LXIV 357 'testis erit
magnis uirtutibus unda Scamandri' and the passages there cited by
Fordyce. For <i>non negat</i> Professor A. Dalzell cites Catullus IV 6-7
'negat ... negare'.</p>

<p><b>20. PVNICEAM GETICO SANGVINE FECIT AQVAM.</b> Similar language at ix 79-80
(of Flaccus) 'hic raptam Troesmin celeri uirtute recepit, / <i>infecitque
fero sanguine Danuuium</i>'.</p>

<p><b>21. AEGISSOS.</b> The city, the modern Tulcea, is situated about 110
kilometres directly north of Tomis (Constan&#355;a) on the southernmost
branch of the Danube, 60 kilometres from the mouth of the river. At <i>EP</i>
I viii 11-20 Ovid describes the recapture of the city from the Getes;
evidently the city had been lost once again.</p>

<p><i>Aegissos</i> is the spelling certified by three of the five sources cited
by Mommsen (<i>CIL</i> III page 1009), namely Hierocles <i>Synecdemus</i> 637 14,
<i>Notitia dignitatum</i> 99, and Procopius <i>Aed</i> IV 7 20. The <i>Itinerarium
Antoninianum</i> (226 2) offers <i>Aegiso</i> (ablative); Ehwald (<i>KB</i> 41),
citing Mommsen, took this as sufficient justification for retaining the
single <i>s</i> of the <i>Ex Ponto</i> manuscripts, although the now lost
Strasbourg manuscript had <i>egissus</i> at I viii 13 (and an indication of
an alternative ending in <i>-os</i>). The <i>Ravenna Cosmography</i> (4 5),
Mommsen's final source, reads <i>Aegypsum</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p><b>27. TE SVBEVNTE RECEPTA.</b> 'Recaptured on your attack'. Intransitive
<i>subire</i> in this sense belongs to military vocabulary: compare Caesar
<i>BG</i> VII 85 'alii tela coniciunt, alii testudine facta <i>subeunt</i>' and
Curtius IV 2 23. For instances from military prose of <i>subire</i> with a
direct object see Caesar <i>BG</i> II 27 '<i>subire</i> iniquissimum locum',
Hirtius <i>BG</i> VIII 15, <i>Bell Alex</i> 76 2 '<i>subierant</i> iniquum locum', and
<i>Bell Hisp</i> 24 2.</p>

<p><b>22. INGENIO ... LOCI.</b> 'The nature (i.e. difficulty) of its terrain'. The
same standard phrase at Tac <i>Ann</i> VI 41 'locorumque ingenio', <i>Hist</i> I
51 'diu infructuosam et asperam militiam tolerauerant <i>ingenio loci</i>
caelique ['climate']', and from Ovid <i>Tr</i> V x 17-18 'tumulus defenditur
ipse / moenibus exiguis ingenioque loci' and <i>EP</i> II i 52 '[oppida ...]
nec satis <i>ingenio</i> tuta fuisse <i>loci</i>'.</p>

<p><b>22. NIL OPIS.</b> The expression is rather prosaic: compare Cic <i>Fam</i> IV i 1
'<i>aliquid opis</i> rei publicae tulissemus'.</p>

<p><b>23. DVBIVM</b> <i>BMFHIT</i> DVBIVM EST <i>CL</i>. The same variant in many
manuscripts at <i>EP</i> III i 17-18 (Ovid is addressing Tomis) 'nec tibi
sunt fontes laticis nisi paene marini, / qui potus <i>dubium</i> sistat
alatne sitim'.</p>

<p><b>24. NVBIBVS AEQVA.</b> 'As high as the clouds'. For this use of <i>aequus</i>
compare <i>Aen</i> IX 674 'abietibus iuuenes patriis in [<i>Heyne</i>: et <i>codd</i>;

altitudinem eductos', and <i>Aen</i> IV 89 '<i>aequataque</i> machina caelo'.</p>

<p><b>25. SITHONIO</b> = <i>Thracio</i>.</p>

<p><b>25. INTERCEPERAT.</b> <i>Intercipere</i> 'capture' common in Livy (IX 43 3, XXI 1
5, XXVI 51 12, XXXVI 31 10); compare Ammianus XX 7 17 &amp; XX 10 3 'locis
... recuperatis quae olim barbari intercepta retinebant ut propria'.</p>

<p><b>26. EREPTAS VICTOR HABEBAT OPES.</b> Similar phrasing at <i>Fast</i> III 49-51
'hoc ubi cognouit contemptor Amulius aequi / (nam <i>raptas</i> fratri
<i>uictor habebat opes</i>), / amne iubet mergi geminos'.</p>

<p><b>27. FLVMINEA ... VNDA.</b> <i>Flumineus</i> does not occur elsewhere in the
<i>Tristia</i> or <i>Ex Ponto</i>; <i>fluminea ... aqua</i> at <i>Fast</i> II 46 &amp; 596.</p>

<p><b>27. VITELLIVS.</b> This Vitellius is presumably one of the four sons of
Publius Vitellius, grandfather of the emperor. Suetonius wrote of the
sons, Aulus, Quintus, Publius, and Lucius, that they were 'quattuor
filios amplissimae dignitatis cognomines ac tantum praenominibus
distinctos' (<i>Vit</i> 2 2). Heinsius suggested Aulus (<i>cos</i> AD 32) was the
one here meant, 'nisi ad L. Vitellium patrem [<i>sc</i> principis] referre
mauis'. 'On the general and reasonable assumption', wrote Syme (<i>HO</i>
90), 'this is P. Vitellius'. But Suetonius calls P. Vitellius 'Germanici
comes', and he is heard of in 15 assisting Germanicus in a campaign (Tac
<i>Ann</i> I 70 1): it is perhaps more likely that Publius would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> been
with Germanicus at the time of the capture of Aegissos, and that another
of the brothers is meant. Certainty is in any case not attainable.</p>

<p><b>29. PROGENIES ALTI FORTISSIMA DONNI.</b> For the phrasing, compare <i>EP</i> II
ix 1-2 'Regia <i>progenies</i>, cui nobilitatis origo / nomen in Eumolpi
peruenit usque ['goes back to'], Coty'.</p>

<p>The Donnus here referred to is Vestalis' grandfather (<i>CIL</i> V 7817), or
possibly a more distant ancestor. Vestalis' father, Cottius, became a
client of Augustus; at XV 10 7 Ammianus mentions the worship still
accorded Cottius 'quod iusto moderamine rexerat suos, et ascitus in
societatem rei Romanae quietem genti praestitit sempiternam'. At <i>Nero</i>
18 Suetonius mentions as one of the few additions to the empire under
Nero the 'regnum ... Alpium defuncto Cottio'. This Cottius would probably
have been Vestalis' older brother; Andr&eacute; is therefore right to infer
that Vestalis 'n'&eacute;tait pas l'h&eacute;ritier du tr&ocirc;ne, ce qu'Ovide n'aurait pas
manqu&eacute; de signaler'.</p>

<p><b>30. IMPETVS.</b> <i>Impetus</i> + infinitive usually indicates a mad impulse: the
only other exception in Ovid is <i>Met</i> V 287-88 (one of the Muses
speaking) '<i>impetus ire fuit</i>; claudit sua tecta Pyreneus / uimque
parat, quam nos sumptis effugimus alis'.</p>

<p><b>31. CONSPICVVS LONGE FVLGENTIBVS ARMIS.</b> Modelled on <i>Aen</i> XI 769
'<i>insignis longe</i> Phrygiis <i>fulgebat</i> in <i>armis</i>'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p><b>32. FORTIA NE POSSINT FACTA LATERE CAVES.</b> Vestalis would in any case
have fought bravely; so that his deeds would not pass unnoticed, he led
the attack.</p>

<p><b>33. INGENTIQVE GRADV.</b> When Ovid elsewhere use <i>ingens gradus</i> (<i>passus</i>)
he gives the phrase a humorous tone: see <i>Am</i> III i 11 'uenit et
<i>ingenti</i> uiolenta Tragoedia <i>passu</i>', <i>AA</i> III 303-4 'illa uelut
coniunx Vmbri rubicunda mariti / ambulat <i>ingentes</i> uarica fertque
<i>gradus'</i>, and <i>Met</i> XIII 776-77 (of Polyphemus) 'gradiens <i>ingenti</i>
litora <i>passu</i> / degrauat'. The straightforwardness of this passage is
of a piece with the rest of the poem.</p>

<p>For an example of the normal epic use of this detail, see <i>Aen</i> X 572
'longe gradientem'.</p>

<p><b>33. FERRVM LOCVMQVE</b> reflects 23 'dubium <i>positu</i> melius defensa
<i>manune</i>'.</p>

<p><b>34. SAXAQVE ... GRANDINE PLVRA.</b> The same phrase in the same metrical
position at <i>Ibis</i> 467-68 'aut te deuoueat certis Abdera diebus, /
<i>saxaque</i> deuotum <i>grandine plura</i> petant'.</p>

<p><b>35. MISSA SVPER IACVLORVM TVRBA.</b> 'The crowding missiles hurled from
above' (Wheeler).</p>

<p><b>38. FERE.</b> Heinsius' FERO would involve the repetition of <i>fero</i> in 44;
and <i>fero uulnere</i> would be rather feeble when applied to a shield.</p>

<p>Professor R. J. Tarrant points out to me that Ovid's description of
Vestalis' exploit may have served as a distant model for Lucan's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
account of how a centurion named Scaeua rallied Caesar's forces and led
an attack against Pompey's encampment (VI 140-262). Scaeua was made
<i>primipilaris</i> in reward for his bravery (Caesar <i>BC</i> III 53 5).</p>

<p><b>40. SED MINOR EST ACRI LAVDIS AMORE DOLOR.</b> Similar language of a similar
exploit at <i>Met</i> XI 525-28 'ut miles, numero praestantior omni, / cum
saepe adsiluit defensae moenibus urbis, / spe potitur tandem <i>laudisque
accensus amore</i> / inter mille uiros murum tamen occupat unus'. Ovid's
description of Vestalis' exploit is little more than a string of
conventional phrases.</p>

<p><b>40. ACRI.</b> 'Sharp'. Compare ii 36 'immensum gloria <i>calcar</i> habet'.</p>

<p><b>41-42. TALIS APVD TROIAM DANAIS PRO NAVIBVS AIAX / DICITVR HECTOREAS
SVSTINVISSE FACES.</b> Compare <i>Met</i> XIII 7-8 (Ajax speaking of Ulysses) 'at

classe fugaui' and <i>Met</i> XIII 384-85 (the death of Ajax) 'Hectora qui
solus, qui ferrum ignesque Iouemque / sustinuit totiens, unam non
sustinet iram'. All three passages are drawn from <i>Il</i> XV 674-746, the
description of how Ajax repulsed Hector's attempt to set the Greek ships
afire, and in particular from 730-31
'&#7956;&#957;&#952;' &#7940;&#961;' &#8005; &#947;' &#7957;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#954;&#949;&#953; &#948;&#949;&#948;&#959;&#954;&#951;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;,

<p><b>43. DEXTERA DEXTRAE.</b> Ovid used syncope in <i>dextera</i> where metrically
convenient. Elsewhere when he employs the two forms he is usually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
describing the joining of hands in pledge or friendship. See <i>Her</i> II 31
'commissaque <i>dextera dextrae</i>', <i>Her</i> XII 90 '<i>dextrae dextera</i> iuncta

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VIII_To_Suillius" id="VIII_To_Suillius"></a>VIII. To Suillius</h2>


<p>This poem, nominally addressed to Suillius, husband of Ovid's
stepdaughter, is in fact directed to Germanicus, of whose staff Suillius
was a member (see at 23 [<a href="#Page_264">pp 264-65</a>]).</p>

<p>Ovid begins the poem by expressing his pleasure at receiving, at last, a
letter from Suillius, saying he hopes that Suillius does not feel
ashamed of being related to him by marriage (1-20). He then asks him to
address Germanicus on his behalf (21-26). In 27-30 he says how grateful
he will be if Germanicus assists him; at 31 he begins to address
Germanicus directly in a tripartite defence of poetry. The first part
(31-42) builds on 34 'Naso suis opibus, <i>carmine</i>, gratus erit': Ovid is
now poor, but can still offer Germanicus his poetry. The second section
(43-66) builds on 43-44 'nec tamen officio uatum per <i>carmina</i> facto /
principibus res est aptior ulla uiris', and explains how verse brings
immortality to great men and their deeds. The third section (67-78)
offers culminating evidence for the value of poetry: Germanicus is
himself a poet. Ovid moves from this to a final plea that Germanicus
help his fellow-poet: once removed from Tomis, he will praise him in
verse (79-88). In the final distich of the poem, he asks Suillius to
assist his prayer.</p>

<p>The structure of the poem is similar to that of <i>Tr</i> V ii. In that poem
Ovid addresses his wife for the first thirty-eight lines, telling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> her
of his misery and asking her to approach Augustus on his behalf. In the
six lines that follow, he asks himself what he will do if she fails him;
he answers that he will make his own direct approach to Augustus. The
final thirty-four lines are his prayer to Augustus, in which he
describes the hardships he endures at Tomis and begs for a mitigation of
his punishment. It is remarkable that in both poems direct addresses to
members of the imperial family should be disguised in this way: it seems
probable that <i>Tr</i> II, Ovid's long defence of his conduct, had been
received by Augustus with hostility, and that he was thenceforth more
circumspect.</p>

<p><b>1-2. SERA QVIDEM ... GRATA TAMEN.</b> <i>Tamen</i> goes with <i>grata</i>, balancing
<i>quidem</i>. For instances of the separate <i>serus tamen</i> idiom ('it is late
in happening, but it does in fact happen') see Nisbet and Hubbard at Hor
<i>Carm</i> I xv 19.</p>

<p><b>1. SERA QVIDEM.</b> It seems that in spite of his being a close relative of
Ovid, Suillius, like Sextus Pompeius (see the introduction to i), had
been reluctant to be openly associated with him.</p>

<p><b>1. STVDIIS EXCVLTE.</b> 'Refined'. <i>Studiis</i> adds little to the force of
<i>exculte</i>: the same idiom at Quintilian XII ii 1 'mores ante omnia
oratori <i>studiis</i> erunt <i>excolendi</i>' and Cic <i>Tusc</i> I 4 'ergo in Graecia
musici floruerunt, discebantque id omnes, nec qui nesciebat satis
<i>excultus doctrina</i> putabatur'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p><b>1. SVILLI.</b> P. Suillius Rufus (<i>PW</i> IV A,l 719-22; <i>PIR<sup>1</sup></i> S 700) is
otherwise chiefly known to us from three passages of Tacitus: Suillius
is presented as 'strong, savage, and unbridled' (Syme <i>Tacitus</i> 332). At
<i>Ann</i> IV 31, Tacitus describes how, in 24, Tiberius insisted that
Suillius, convicted of accepting a bribe, be relegated to an island
rather than merely be exiled from Italy; what seemed cruelty at the time
later seemed wisdom in view of his later behaviour as a favourite of
Claudius. At <i>Ann</i> XI 1-7 Tacitus describes how Suillius' excesses
resulted in a proposal in the Senate to revive the <i>lex Cincia</i> of 204
BC, by which advocates had been forbidden remuneration: the proposal was
modified by Claudius at the instance of Suillius and others affected so
as to establish a maximum fee of ten thousand sesterces. At <i>Ann</i> XIII
42-43 (AD 58) Tacitus tells how Suillius, 'imperitante Claudio
terribilis ac uenalis', was charged with extortion as proconsul of Asia
and with laying malicious charges under Claudius. Banished to the
Balearic islands, he led a luxurious existence, remaining unrepentant.</p>

<p><b>3-4. PIA SI POSSIT SVPEROS LENIRE ROGANDO / GRATIA.</b> Compare 21 'si quid
agi sperabis posse <i>precando</i>'.</p>

<p><b>5-6. ANIMI SVM FACTVS AMICI / DEBITOR.</b> 'Your friendly purpose has placed
me in your debt' (Wheeler). The genitive similarly used for the cause of
indebtedness at i 2 <i>'debitor</i> est <i>uitae</i> qui tibi, Sexte, suae' and
<i>Tr</i> I v 10 'perpetuusque <i>animae debitor huius</i> ero'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p><b>6. MERITVM VELLE IVVARE VOCO.</b> 'I call the desire to help a favour
already given'. Otto <i>uelle</i> 2 cites <i>EP</i> III iv 79 'ut desint uires,
<i>tamen est laudanda uoluntas</i>', Prop II x 5-6 'quod si deficient uires,
audacia certe / laus erit: in magnis <i>et uoluisse sat est</i>', <i>Pan Mess</i>
3-7, <i>Laus Pisonis</i> 214; the same proverb at Sen <i>Ben</i> V 2 2 'uoluntas
ipsa rectum petens laudanda est'.</p>

<p><b>7. IMPETVS ISTE TVVS LONGVM MODO DVRET IN AEVVM.</b> Similar phrasing at
<i>EP</i> II vi 35-36 (Graecinus has been rendering Ovid assistance) 'fac
modo permaneas lasso, Graecine, fidelis, / <i>duret et in longas impetus
iste moras</i>'.</p>

<p><b>9. IVS ALIQVOD.</b> 'A certain claim on each other'. The same phrase for a
similar situation at <i>EP</i> I vii 60 (to Messalinus, elder brother of
Cotta Maximus) '<i>ius aliquod</i> tecum fratris amicus habet'.</p>

<p><b>9. ADFINIA.</b> The <i>adfinis</i> was a relative by marriage, commonly, as here,
a son-in-law; a relative by common descent was a <i>cognatus</i>.</p>

<p><b>9. ADFINIA VINCVLA.</b> <i>Vinculum</i> used of family relationships at <i>Met</i> IX
550 (Byblis wishes to marry her brother) 'expetit ... <i>uinclo</i> tecum
propiore ligari' and Cic <i>Planc</i> 27 'cum illo maximis <i>uinclis</i> et
propinquitatis et <i>adfinitatis</i> coniunctus'.</p>

<p><b>10. INLABEFACTA.</b> The word elsewhere in Latin only at xii 29-30 'haec
... concordia ... uenit ad albentes <i>inlabefacta</i> comas'. Ovid is fond of
using negative participles of this type.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p><b>11-12. NAM TIBI QVAE CONIVNX, EADEM MIHI FILIA PAENE EST, / ET QVAE TE
GENERVM, ME VOCAT ILLA VIRVM.</b> The same type of circumlocution at <i>Her</i>
III 45-48 (Briseis to Achilles) "diruta Marte tuo Lyrnesia moenia uidi;
... uidi ... tres cecidisse <i>quibus</i> [<i>Bentley</i>: tribus <i>codd</i>] <i>quae
mihi, mater erat</i>'.</p>

<p><b>11. EADEM MIHI FILIA PAENE EST.</b> This is presumably Perilla, the
recipient of <i>Tr</i> III vii, whom Ovid there speaks of in terms
appropriate to a stepfather.</p>

<p><b>13-14. EI MIHI, SI LECTIS VVLTVM TV VERSIBVS ISTIS / DVCIS, ET ADFINEM
TE PVDET ESSE MEVM.</b> A similar lament at <i>EP</i> II ii 5-6 '<i>ei mihi, si
lecto uultus</i> tibi nomine non est / qui fuit, et dubitas cetera
perlegere!'; both passages are followed by defences of Ovid's character.</p>

<p>For <i>uultum ... ducis</i> see at i 5 <i>trahis uultus</i> (<a href="#Page_149">p 149</a>).</p>

<p><b>15. NIHIL</b> <i>BCMFHLT</i> NIL <i>I</i>. Copyists were more prone to alter <i>nil</i> to
<i>nihil</i> than the inverse; but in 1919 Housman demonstrated that <i>nihil</i>
was Ovid's invariable form for the latter half of the first foot by
pointing out that in all of the twenty-odd passages where the
manuscripts offer <i>nihil</i> or <i>nil</i> at that position the following word
invariably begins with a vowel (<i>Collected Papers</i> 1000-1003). There
would be no reason for such an avoidance of consonants if Ovid had
allowed <i>nil</i> in this position; he must therefore have used <i>nihil</i>
alone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p><b>16. FORTVNAM, QVAE MIHI CAECA FVIT.</b> The image of Fortune being blind to
a single individual seems very strange. Professor R. J. Tarrant suggests
that <i>caeca</i> could mean 'unforeseeing', and by <i>fortunam</i> Ovid could be
referring to his own previous circumstances; alternatively, <i>caeca</i>
might be a corruption induced by the familiar image of the blind
goddess, replacing an original SAEVA (Riese) or LAEVA, for which compare
Silius III 93-94 'si promissum uertat <i>Fortuna</i> fauorem, / <i>laeuaque sit
coeptis</i>'.</p>

<p><b>17-18. SEV GENVS EXCVTIAS, EQVITES AB ORIGINE PRIMA / VSQVE PER
INNVMEROS INVENIEMVR AVOS.</b> A similar claim at <i>Tr</i> IV x 7-8 'usque a
proauis uetus ordinis heres, / non modo fortunae munere factus eques'.
The status of <i>eques</i> was not hereditary except in the case of a
senator's son. The Paeligni did not receive the citizenship until after
the Social War; to be born to equestrian status, and to assume that he
could have had a senatorial career (<i>Tr</i> IV x 35), Ovid must have
belonged to one of the dominant families of the region.</p>

<p><b>17. EXCVTIAS.</b> 'Examine'. Ovid plays on the primary meaning of the word,
'shake out', at <i>Am</i> I viii 45-46 'has quoque quae frontis rugas in
uertice portant [<i>Burman</i>: quas ... portas <i>codd</i>] / <i>excute</i>; de rugis
crimina multa cadent'. The transferred meaning had lost any sense of
metaphor by Ovid's time, however; see especially <i>Tr</i> II 224
'<i>excutiasque</i> oculis otia nostra ['the product of my leisure
hours'&mdash;Wheeler] tuis'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p><b>19-20. SIVE VELIS QVI SINT MORES INQVIRERE NOSTRI, / ERROREM MISERO
DETRAHE, LABE CARENT.</b> A similar claim of no fault beyond his <i>error</i> at
<i>EP</i> II ii 15-16 'est mea culpa grauis, sed quae me perdere solum / ausa
sit, et <i>nullum maius adorta nefas</i>'.</p>

<p><b>20. ERROREM ... DETRAHE.</b> At <i>Met</i> II 38-39 the same phrase with a
different meaning: (Phaethon to his father) 'pignora da, genitor, per
quae tu uera propago / credar, et hunc animis <i>errorem</i> ['doubt']
<i>detrahe</i> nostris*.</p>

<p><b>20. LABE CARENT.</b> The same sense of <i>labes</i> at <i>Tr</i> I ix 43 'uitae <i>labe
carentis</i>' and Prop IV xi 41-42 'neque ulla <i>labe</i> mea nostros erubuisse
focos'; compare as well the phrase <i>sine labe</i> at <i>Tr</i> II 110 (<i>domus</i>),
<i>Tr</i> IV viii 33 (<i>decem lustris ... peractis</i>), <i>EP</i> I ii 143
(<i>praeteriti anni</i>), <i>EP</i> II vii 49 (<i>uita prior</i>), <i>Her</i> XVII 14
(<i>tenor uitae</i>), and <i>Her</i> XVII 69 (<i>fama</i>).</p>

<p><b>22. QVOS COLIS ... DEOS.</b> A similar definition of the imperial family at
<i>EP</i> II ii 123 '<i>quos colis ad superos</i> haec fer mandata sacerdos'.</p>

<p><b>23. DI TIBI SVNT CAESAR IVVENIS.</b> <i>BCFM<sup>2ul</sup></i> read SINT; but the indicative
seems to be required by the preceding 'quos <i>colis</i> ... deos' and the
following '<i>tua numina</i> placa' and 'hac certe nulla est notior <i>ara</i>
tibi'.</p>

<p><b>23. CAESAR IVVENIS.</b> Germanicus; he would have acquired the cognomen
<i>Caesar</i> on his adoption by Tiberius in AD 4. <i>Iuuenis</i> probably refers
to Germanicus' title of <i>princeps iuuentutis</i>, which <i>EP</i> II v 41-42<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
indicates he must have held: 'te <i>iuuenum princeps</i>, cui dat Germania
nomen, / participem studii Caesar habere solet'. Germanicus' holding of
the title is not elsewhere attested.</p>

<p>At <i>Ann</i> IV 31 5, Tacitus identifies Suillius as 'quaestorem quondam
Germanici'; at <i>Ann</i> XIII 42 4, he represents Suillius as saying of
himself and Seneca 'se quaestorem Germanici, illum domus eius adulterum
fuisse'. His service under Germanicus was clearly a principal fact of
his life.</p>

<p><b>25-26. ANTISTITIS ... PRECES.</b> Here <i>antistes</i> is virtually equivalent to
<i>cultor</i>, as at <i>Tr</i> III xiv 1 '<i>Cultor et antistes</i> doctorum sancte
uirorum'; compare as well <i>Met</i> XIII 632-33 'Anius, quo ... <i>antistite</i>
Phoebus / rite <i>colebatur</i>'.</p>

<p><b>27-28. QVAMLIBET EXIGVA SI NOS EA IVVERIT AVRA, / OBRVTA DE MEDIIS CVMBA
RESVRGET AQVIS.</b> Ovid here mixes two nautical metaphors: if a ship is
overwhelmed by high seas, a favouring breeze will not be of great
assistance.</p>

<p><b>28. OBRVTA DE MEDIIS CVMBA RESVRGET AQVIS.</b> Similar wording at [Sen]
<i>Oct</i> 345-48 '[cumba ...] <i>obruta</i> ... ruit in pelagus rursumque salo /
pressa <i>resurgit</i>'.</p>

<p><b>29. TVNC EGO TVRA FERAM RAPIDIS SOLLEMNIA FLAMMIS.</b> Perhaps a verbal
reminiscence of <i>Aen</i> IX 625-26 'Iuppiter omnipotens, audacibus adnue
coeptis. / ipse tibi ad tua templa <i>feram sollemnia</i> dona'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p><b>29. TVRA ... SOLLEMNIA.</b> The phrase does not occur elsewhere in Ovid; but
compare the passage from <i>Aen</i> IX quoted above, as well as the
conjunction of words at <i>Tr</i> III xiii 16 'micaque <i>sollemni turis</i> in
igne sonet'.</p>

<p><b>29. RAPIDIS</b> is here used as a standard epithet; its full force
('destructive') at <i>Met</i> II 122-23 'tum pater ora sui sacro medicamine
nati / contigit et <i>rapidae</i> fecit patientia <i>flammae</i>', <i>Met</i> XII
274-75 'correpti <i>rapida</i>, ueluti seges arida, <i>flamma</i> / arserunt
crines', and <i>EP</i> III iii 60 (to Amor) 'sic numquam <i>rapido</i> lampades
<i>igne</i> uacent'.</p>

<p><b>31-32. NEC TIBI DE PARIO STATVAM, GERMANICE, TEMPLVM / MARMORE.</b>
Professor R. J. Tarrant points out to me the reference to Virgil <i>G</i> III
13-16 'et uiridi in campo <i>templum de marmore</i> ponam ... in medio mihi
Caesar erit templumque tenebit'; <i>Parii lapides</i> are mentioned at III
34. Here Ovid makes the temple literal, and conducts his <i>recusatio</i> in
the terms used by love-poets.</p>

<p><b>32. CARPSIT OPES ... MEAS.</b> 'Has destroyed my wealth'. This is not
strictly true, since Ovid at v 38 says that Pompeius give him gifts
(Ovid's letter speaking) 'ne proprias attenuaret opes'.</p>

<p>The same use of <i>carpere</i> at ix 121-22 'fortuna est impar animo, talique
libenter / exiguas <i>carpo</i> munere pauper opes' and <i>Am</i> I viii 91 'et
soror et mater, nutrix quoque <i>carpat</i> amantem'.</p>

<p><b>34. NASO SVIS OPIBVS, CARMINE, GRATVS ERIT.</b> Compare <i>Am</i> II xvii 27
'sunt mihi pro magno felicia carmina censu' and <i>Am</i> I iii entire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p><b>37. QVAM POTVIT ... MAXIMA.</b> For the idiom compare Cic <i>Fam</i> XIII vi 5
'<i>quam maximas</i> ... gratias agat' and <i>ND</i> II 129 'gallinae ['hens']
... cubilia sibi nidosque construunt eosque <i>quam possunt mollissime</i>
substernunt'.</p>

<p><b>37. GRATVS ABVNDE EST.</b> Apparently the only instance in classical poetry
of <i>abunde</i> modifying an adjective. The prose authors cited by the
lexica are Sallust, Livy, Valerius Maximus, Curtius, the elder Pliny,
and Quintilian. <i>Abunde</i> elsewhere in Ovid only at <i>Met</i> XV 759 'humano
generi, superi, fauistis abunde!' and <i>Tr</i> I vii 31 'laudatus abunde'.</p>

<p><b>38. FINEM PIETAS CONTIGIT ILLA SVVM.</b> 'That act of piety has reached its
objective', that is, has made the giver <i>gratus</i>.</p>

<p><b>39-42.</b> For the sentiment compare <i>EP</i> III iv 81-82 'haec [<i>sc</i> laudanda
uoluntas] facit ut ueniat pauper quoque gratus ad aras, / et placeat
caeso non minus agna boue'.</p>

<p><b>41-42. GRAMINE PASTA FALISCO / VICTIMA TARPEIOS INFICIT ICTA FOCOS.</b>
Compare iv 29-32 'templaque Tarpeiae primum tibi sedis adiri ... colla
boues niueos certae praebere securi, / quos aluit campis <i>herba Falisca</i>
suis'.</p>

<p><b>42. INFICIT.</b> 'Stain'. <i>Inficere</i> in the context of a sacrifice also at
<i>Met</i> XV 134-35 '[uictima ...] percussa ... sanguine cultros / inficit'
and Hor <i>Carm</i> III xiii 6.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p><b>44. PRINCIPIBVS ... VIRIS.</b> A fixed colloquial idiom: <i>OLD princeps<sup>1</sup></i> 5
cites Plautus <i>Amphitruo</i> 204 'delegit <i>uiros</i> primorum <i>principes</i>' and
Hor <i>Ep</i> I xvii 35 '<i>principibus</i> placuisse <i>uiris</i> non ultima laus
est'. There was a parallel expression <i>principes feminae</i>: see Pliny
<i>NH</i> VIII 119 and Tac <i>Ann</i> XIII 42 (Suillius compares himself to
Seneca) 'an grauius aestimandum sponte litigatoris praemium honestae
operae adsequi quam corrumpere cubicula principum feminarum?'.</p>

<p><b>45. CARMINA VESTRARVM PERAGVNT PRAECONIA LAVDVM.</b> <i>Praeconia</i> in a
similar context at <i>Tr</i> II 65 'inuenies uestri <i>praeconia</i> nominis illic
[in the <i>Metamorphoses</i>]'; used with <i>peragere</i> at <i>Tr</i> V i 9 'ut
cecidi, subiti <i>perago praeconia</i> casus'.</p>

<p><b>45. LAVDVM.</b> 'Deeds meriting praise'; compare 87 'tuas ... laudes
... recentes'. The meaning is found even in prose: see Caesar <i>BC</i> II 39
4 'haec tamen ab ipsis inflatius commemorabantur, ut de suis homines
<i>laudibus</i> libenter praedicant' and the other passages cited at <i>OLD</i>
<i>laus<sup>1</sup></i> 3b.</p>

<p><b>46. ACTORVM.</b> AVCTORVM (<i>BCHL</i>) is possible enough; but <i>actorum</i> accords
better with the preceding <i>laudum</i>.</p>

<p><b>46. CADVCA.</b> 'Impermanent'. The sense is frequent in Cicero: see <i>Rep</i> VI
17 'nihil est nisi mortale et <i>caducum</i> praeter animos' and <i>Phil</i> IV
13. Elsewhere in Ovid the usual sense of the word is 'ineffectual': see
<i>Fast</i> I 181-82 'nec lingua <i>caducas</i> / concipit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> ulla preces, dictaque
pondus habent' and <i>Ibis</i> 88 'et sit pars uoti nulla caduca mei'.
Similar uses at <i>Her</i> XV 208 &amp; XVI 169.</p>

<p><b>47. CARMINE FIT VIVAX VIRTVS, EXPERSQVE SEPULCRI / NOTITIAM SERAE
POSTERITATIS HABET.</b> For the immortality given by verse, compare from
Ovid <i>Tr</i> V xiv 5 (to his wife) 'dumque legar, mecum pariter tua fama
legetur' and <i>EP</i> III ii 35-36 (to those friends who assisted him) 'uos
etiam seri laudabunt saepe nepotes, / claraque erit scriptis gloria
uestra meis'. The topic is closely related to that of the poet's own
immortality, for which, in Ovid, see xvi 2-3 'non solet ingeniis summa
nocere dies, / famaque post cineres maior uenit' and <i>Met</i> XV 871-79.</p>

<p>For other poets' treatment of the immortality given by verse, see Prop
III ii 17-26, Hor <i>Carm</i> IV ix, Pindar <i>Nem</i> VII 11-16, Gow on
Theocritus XVI 30, and Murgatroyd on Tib I iv 63-66.</p>

<p><b>47. VIVAX VIRTVS.</b> Compare Hor <i>AP</i> 68-69 'mortalia facta peribunt, /
nedum sermonum stet honos et gratia <i>uiuax</i>'.</p>

<p><b>47. EXPERSQVE SEPVLCRI.</b> The diction of this line is very elevated:
Professor R. J. Tarrant compares <i>Met</i> IX 252-53 (Jupiter speaking of
Hercules) 'aeternum est a me quod traxit, et <i>expers</i> / atque immune
<i>necis</i>' and <i>Cons Liu</i> 59-60 'Caesaris adde domum, quae certe <i>funeris
expers</i> / debuit humanis altior esse malis'. The following line's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span><i>notitiam ... habet</i> is in comparison an anticlimax.</p>

<p><b>49. TABIDA CONSVMIT FERRVM LAPIDEMQVE VETVSTAS.</b> Iron and flint were
proverbial for hardness: compare x 3-4 'ecquos tu silices, ecquod,
carissime, ferrum / duritiae confers, Albinouane, meae?', <i>Her</i> X
109-10, <i>AA</i> I 473-76, <i>Met</i> XIV 712-13, <i>Fast</i> V 131-32, <i>Tr</i> IV vi
13-14, and <i>EP</i> II vii 39-40; other passages are cited by Smith at Tib I
iv 18 'longa dies molli saxa peredit aqua'. At I 313-16, Lucretius,
discussing the invisible wearing away of substances, says 'stilicidi
casus <i>lapidem</i> cauat, uncus aratri / <i>ferreus</i> occulte decrescit uomer
in aruis, / strataque iam uolgi pedibus detrita uiarum / saxea
conspicimus'.</p>

<p><b>51. SCRIPTA FERVNT ANNOS.</b> The phrase completes the sentence begun in the
previous distich, as is shown by the parallel passages <i>Am</i> I x 61-62
'scindentur uestes, gemmae frangentur et aurum; / <i>carmina quam
tribuent, fama perennis erit</i>' and <i>Am</i> I xv 31-32 'ergo cum silices,
cum dens patientis aratri / depereant aeuo, <i>carmina morte carent</i>'.</p>

<p><b>51. FERVNT.</b> 'Withstand'; the same sense at <i>Tr</i> V ix 8 'scripta
<i>uetustatem</i> si modo nostra <i>ferunt</i>', Cic <i>Am</i> 67 'ea uina quae
<i>uetustatem ferunt</i>', Silius IV 399-400 'si modo <i>ferre diem</i> ... carmina
nostra ualent', and Quintilian II 4 9 'sic et <i>annos ferent</i> et
uetustate proficient'.</p>

<p><b>51-53. AGAMEMNONA ... THEBAS.</b> The two great cycles of Greek heroic
mythology. The same conjunction at <i>Am</i> III xii 15-16 'cum <i>Thebae</i>, cum
<i>Troia</i> foret, cum Caesaris acta, / ingenium mouit sola Corinna meum'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>

mutua fratrum / et septem portas sub duce quamque suo'; compare as well
Prop II i 21 '[canerem ...] nec ueteres <i>Thebas</i> nec <i>Pergama</i>, nomen
Homeri'. Lucretius, arguing that the world was created at a definite
moment, wrote 'cur supera ['before'] bellum <i>Thebanum</i> et funera
<i>Troiae</i> / non alias alii quoque res cecinere poetae?' (V 326-27).</p>

<p><b>52. QVISQVIS CONTRA VEL SIMVL ARMA TVLIT.</b> The leaders of the Greeks and
Trojans.</p>

<p>The line's structure parallels 54 'quicquid post haec, quicquid et ante
fuit'. Both are conspicuous by their lack of adornment.</p>

<p><b>55. DI QVOQVE CARMINIBVS, SI FAS EST DICERE, FIVNT.</b> This is possibly a
reference to Herodotus II 53, where Herodotus says that Homer and Hesiod
established the Greek pantheon; for Ovid's borrowings from Herodotus,
see at iii 37 <i>opulentia Croesi</i> (<a href="#Page_189">p 189</a>). The same idea previously in
Xenophanes (fr. 11 Diels).</p>

<p>The line looks ahead to 63-64 'et modo, Caesar, auum, quem uirtus
addidit astris, / sacrarunt aliqua carmina parte tuum'.</p>

<p><b>55. SI FAS EST DICERE.</b> Ovid here apologizes for the shocking statement
he is making. Up to this point poetry has helped give lasting fame to
what was already a fact, but here poetry is actually making something
happen (or appear to happen). At <i>Am</i> III xii 21-40 Ovid similarly
describes how poets created the myths.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p><b>57-64.</b> Ovid follows the same sequence in the <i>Metamorphoses</i>, describing
the separation of Chaos at I 5-31, the attack of the Giants at I 151-55,
Bacchus' conquest of India at IV 20-21 &amp; 605-6, and Hercules' capture of
Oechalia at IX 136; he foretells Augustus' apotheosis at XV 868-70.
Professor R. J. Tarrant points out that these lines may well be
referring specifically to the earlier poem.</p>

<p><b>57-58. SIC CHAOS EX ILLA NATVRAE MOLE PRIORIS / DIGESTVM PARTES SCIMVS
HABERE SVAS.</b> 'Thus we know Chaos now has its divisions after having been
arranged in order from the famous mass that was its previous nature'.
Ovid describes the separation of the elements at <i>Met</i> I 25-31 and
<i>Fast</i> I 103-10; see also <i>Ecl</i> VI 31-36.</p>

<p>I take <i>illa</i> ('famous') to refer to the familiarity through the poets
and philosophers of the notion of the separation of Chaos into the four
elements. Alternatively, Professor A. Dalzell points out to me that
<i>illa</i> could have a pejorative sense.</p>

<p><b>58. DIGESTVM.</b> 'Separated'. At <i>Met</i> I 7 Ovid calls Chaos 'rudis
<i>indigestaque</i> moles'.</p>

<p><b>59. ADFECTANTES CAELESTIA REGNA GIGANTAS.</b> At <i>Am</i> III xii 27 Ovid,
speaking of false legends created by the poets, says 'fecimus Enceladon
iaculantem mille lacertis'.</p>

<p>In his youth, Ovid had attempted but later abandoned a poem on the
battle of the Giants against Jupiter 'designed to glorify Augustus under
the guise of Jupiter' (Owen <i>Tristia II</i> p. 77): the language he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> uses
at <i>Tr</i> II 333-40 seems too explicit to be a mere instance of the
love-poet's defence of his subject-matter: 'at si me iubeas domitos
Iouis igne Gigantas [<i>Heinsius</i>: Gigantes <i>codd</i>] / dicere, conantem
debilitabit onus. / diuitis ingenii est immania Caesaris acta / condere,
materia ne superetur opus. / <i>et tamen ausus eram</i>; sed detrectare
uidebar, / quodque nefas, damno uiribus esse tuis.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> / ad leue rursus
opus, iuuenalia carmina, ueni, / et falso moui pectus amore meum'. He
refers to the same poem again at <i>Am</i> II i 11-18 'ausus eram, memini,
<i>caelestia</i> dicere bella / centimanumque Gyen&mdash;et satis oris erat&mdash; / cum
male se Tellus ulta est, ingestaque Olympo / ardua deuexum Pelion Ossa
tulit. / in manibus nimbos et cum Ioue fulmen habebam, / quod bene pro
caelo mitteret ille suo&mdash; / clausit amica fores! ego cum Ioue fulmen
omisi; / excidit ingenio Iuppiter ipse meo'.</p>

<p>The actual descriptions of the Giants' rebellion in Ovid's surviving
poems are brief (<i>Met</i> I 151-62 &amp; 182-86, <i>Fast</i> V 35-42), but
references to the rebellion are frequent (<i>Met</i> X 150-51, <i>Fast</i> I
307-8, <i>Fast</i> IV 593-94, <i>Fast</i> V 555, <i>Tr</i> II 71, <i>Tr</i> IV vii 17, <i>EP</i>
II ii 9-12). The accounts at <i>Met</i> V 319-31 of the flight of some of the
gods to Egypt and at <i>Fast</i> II 459-74 of Venus' flight to the Euphrates
are no doubt derived from Ovid's earlier researches.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p><b>59. ADFECTANTES.</b> 'Unlawfully seeking to obtain'; compare <i>Met</i> I 151-52
'neue foret terris securior arduus aether, / <i>adfectasse</i> ferunt <i>regnum
caeleste Gigantas</i>' and <i>Fast</i> III 439 'ausos <i>caelum adfectare
Gigantas</i>'. This sense is found in prose: compare Livy I 50 4 'cui enim
non apparere <i>adfectare</i> eum imperium in Latinos?'. At Livy I 46 2 the
word is used without the conative sense: 'neque ea res Tarquinio spem
<i>adfectandi</i> regni minuit'.</p>

<p><b>59. GIGANTAS</b> <i>Heinsius</i>. The manuscripts have GIGANTES, which Lenz,
Wheeler, and Andr&eacute; print. In classical Latin poetry, Greek nouns of the
third declension with plural nominatives in <i>-&#949;&#962;</i> and plural
accusatives in <i>-&#945;&#962;</i> retained these endings. Housman 836-39
gives many instances where metre demonstrates an accusative in
<i>-&#945;&#962;</i>. In Ovid when such an ending occurs, some manuscripts
commonly offer the normalized <i>-es</i>; at <i>Tr</i> II 333, as here, all
manuscripts offer <i>Gigantes</i>, again corrected by Heinsius.</p>

<p>Such apparent violations of the rule as <i>Fast</i> I 717 'horreat
Aenead&#257;s et primus et ultimus orbis', <i>Fast</i> III 105-6 'quis tunc aut
Hyad&#257;s aut Pliadas Atlanteas / senserat' and Virgil <i>G</i> I 137-38
'nauita tum stellis numeros et nomina fecit, / Pleiad&#257;s, Hyad&#257;s,
claramque Lycaonis Arcton' are of course no real exceptions, the
lengthening of short closed vowels at the ictus being permitted
(Platnauer 59-62).</p>

<p><b>60. AD STYGA NIMBIFERI VINDICIS IGNE DATOS.</b> 'Hurled to the underworld by
the lightning-bolt of cloud-gathering Jupiter'. This was Jupiter's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
first use of the weapon: see <i>Fast</i> III 439-40 'fulmina post ausos
caelum adfectare Gigantas / sumpta Ioui: <i>primo tempore inermis erat</i>'.</p>

<p><b>60. NIMBIFERI VINDICIS IGNE</b> is my correction of the manuscripts'
NIMBIFERO and NVBIFERO. The unmodified <i>uindicis</i> and modified <i>igne</i> of
the manuscript readings might be defended by <i>EP</i> II ix 77 'quicquid id
est [whatever Ovid has committed], habuit moderatam uindicis iram', but
<i>uindicis</i> is there defined by the following 'qui nisi natalem nil mihi
dempsit humum', and <i>moderatam</i> is a more suitable epithet for <i>iram</i>
than is <i>nimbifero</i> for <i>igne</i> in the present passage., At <i>Tr</i> II
143-44 'uidi ego pampineis oneratam uitibus ulmum, / quae fuerat <i>saeuo
fulmine</i> tacta Iouis', the manuscripts divide between <i>saeuo</i> and
<i>saeui</i>, which has a good claim to be considered the true reading; in
any case, <i>Iouis</i> is less in need of a defining adjective than
<i>uindicis</i> in the present passage. Finally, the genitive here is
strongly supported by <i>Ibis</i> 475-76 'ut Macedo rapidis icta est cum
coniuge flammis, / sic precor <i>aetherii uindicis</i> igne cadas'.</p>

<p>The corruption may have been induced by a wish to introduce interlocking
word order: for a similar instance see at ii 9 <i>Baccho uina Falerna</i>
(<a href="#Page_164">p 164</a>). But in fact substantive and epithet are constantly found linked at
the caesura of the pentameter: the strong break in the metre at that
point no doubt made the construction more readily acceptable there than
in other positions.</p>

<p>I have printed <i>nimbiferi</i> in preference to <i>nubiferi</i> because Jupiter
is linked with <i>nimbi</i> at two other passages. The first of these is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
<i>Am</i> II i 15-16 'in manibus <i>nimbos et cum Ioue fulmen</i> habebam, / quod
bene pro caelo mitteret ille suo', and the second <i>Met</i> III 299-301,
where Ovid describes Jupiter's preparations to descend on Semele:
'aethera conscendit uultuque sequentia traxit / nubila, quis <i>nimbos</i>
immixtaque fulgura uentis / addidit et tonitrus et ineuitabile fulmen'.</p>

<p><b>61-62. SIC VICTOR LAVDEM SVPERATIS LIBER AB INDIS ... TRAXIT.</b> Bacchus'
conquest of India is also mentioned by Ovid at <i>Fast</i> III 465-66
'interea Liber depexos crinibus Indos / uicit et Eoo diues ab orbe
redit', <i>Fast</i> III 719-20, and <i>Tr</i> V iii 23-24.</p>

<p><b>61-62. VICTOR</b> should be taken both with <i>Liber</i> and <i>Alcides</i>.</p>

<p><b>61-62. LIBER ... ALCIDES.</b> The same pairing (both times in the context of
Augustan panegyric) at <i>Aen</i> VI 801-5 'nec uero <i>Alcides</i> tantum
telluris obiuit, / fixerit aeripedem ceruam licet, aut Erymanthi /
pacarit nemora et Lernam tremefecerit arcu; / nec qui pampineis uictor
iuga flectit habenis / <i>Liber</i>, agens celso Nysae de uertice tigris' and
Hor <i>Carm</i> III iii 9-15. Ovid may have made similar mention of Bacchus
and Hercules in his panegyric of Augustus.</p>

<p><b>61-62. SIC ... LAVDEM ... ALCIDES CAPTA TRAXIT AB OECHALIA.</b> Hercules
attacked and captured Oechalia in order to carry off Iole, the king's
daughter. This was his last exploit, for it led to Deianira's sending
him the poisoned robe which caused his death. The capture of Oechalia is
also mentioned at <i>Her</i> IX <i>passim</i> (the poem perhaps not by Ovid) and
<i>Met</i> IX 136-40.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p><b>62. OECHALIA.</b> For the quadrisyllable ending to the pentameter, see at ii
10 <i>Alcinoo</i> (<a href="#Page_164">p 164</a>).</p>

<p><b>63. AVVM.</b> Augustus. In AD 4 Augustus adopted Tiberius (son of Livia's
first husband, Ti. Claudius Nero), and Tiberius adopted Germanicus, son
of his brother Drusus.</p>

<p><b>63. QVEM VIRTVS ADDIDIT ASTRIS.</b> Compare <i>Aen</i> VIII 301 (of Hercules)
'salue, uera Iouis proles, decus <i>addite diuis</i>'.</p>

<p>Augustus died on 19 August AD 14; on 17 September the Senate decreed
<i>caelestes religiones</i> for him (Tac <i>Ann</i> I 10 8; <i>Fasti Amiternini,
Antiates, &amp; Oppiani</i>, at Ehrenberg-Jones 52). Augustus' apotheosis is
also mentioned at ix 127-32 and xiii 23-26.</p>

<p><b>64. ALIQVA ... PARTE.</b> The same phrase in the same metrical position at
<i>Fast</i> I 133-34 (Janus speaking) 'uis mea narrata est. causam nunc disce
figurae: / iam tamen hanc <i>aliqua</i> tu quoque <i>parte</i> uides'.</p>

<p><b>64. CARMINA.</b> Ovid is referring to his own poems (in Latin and Getic) on
Augustus' apotheosis, also mentioned at vi 17-18 'de caelite ... recenti
... carmen', ix 131-32 'carmina ... de te ... caelite ... nouo', and xiii
25-26.</p>

<p><b>65-66. SI QVID ADHVC IGITVR VIVI, GERMANICE, NOSTRO / RESTAT IN INGENIO,
SERVIET OMNE TIBI.</b> Compare Prop IV i 59-60 'sed tamen exiguo
<i>quodcumque</i> e pectore <i>riui</i> / fluxerit, hoc patriae <i>seruiet omne
meae</i>', which Ovid is clearly imitating. Hertzberg <i>ad loc</i> conjectured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
RIVI for our passage, which may well be right; but <i>uiui</i> seems to agree
better with <i>restat</i>.</p>

<p><b>67. VATIS ... VATES.</b> For an extreme instance of Ovid's favourite figure
of <i>polyptoton</i> (Quintilian IX 3 36-37), see the account at <i>Met</i> IX
43-45 of Achelous' wrestling-match with Hercules: 'inque gradu stetimus,
certi non cedere, eratque / cum <i>pede pes</i> iunctus, totoque ego pectore
pronus / et <i>digitos digitis</i> et <i>frontem fronte</i> premebam'. Other
instances of polyptoton with <i>uates</i> at <i>Fast</i> I 25 (to Germanicus) 'si
licet et fas est, <i>uates</i> rege <i>uatis</i> habenas' and <i>EP</i> II ix 65 (to
Cotys, king of Thrace, apparently a writer of poetry) 'ad <i>uatem uates</i>
orantia bracchia tendo',</p>

<p><b>67. VATES.</b> Approximately nine hundred lines survive of a version of
Aratus generally attributed to Germanicus, who might have been composing
the poem at the time Ovid was writing: Augustus' apotheosis is mentioned
at 558-60. It is possible however that Tiberius was the poem's author:
he is known to have written a <i>Conquestio de morte L. Caesaris</i> and to
have composed Greek verse (Suet <i>Tib</i> 70). For a full discussion see the
introduction to Gain's edition of the <i>Aratus</i>.</p>

<p><b>69-70. QVOD NISI TE NOMEN TANTVM AD MAIORA VOCASSET, / GLORIA PIERIDVM
SVMMA FVTVRVS ERAS.</b> Compare <i>Met</i> V 269-70 (the Muses to Minerva) 'o
nisi te uirtus opera ad maiora tulisset, / in partem uentura chori
Tritonia nostri'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a striking parallel to this passage in Quintilian's address to
Domitian in his catalogue of poets: 'hos nominamus quia Germanicum
Augustum ab institutis studiis deflexit cura terrarum, parumque dis
uisum est esse eum maximum poetarum' (X i 91-92).</p>

<p><b>70. GLORIA PIERIDVM SVMMA.</b> <i>Gloria</i> similarly used at <i>EP</i> II xi 28
'maxima Fundani <i>gloria</i>, Rufe, soli', <i>Aen</i> VI 767 'proximus ille
Procas, Troianae <i>gloria</i> gentis', and Val Max IV iii 3 'Drusum
... Germanicum, eximiam Claudiae familiae <i>gloriam</i>'. The term was used
in particular of fine cattle: see <i>AA</i> I 290 'candidus, armenti gloria,
taurus', <i>Pan Mess</i> (<i>Corp Tib</i> III vii) 208 'tardi pecoris ... <i>gloria</i>
taurus' and <i>Aetna</i> 597 '<i>gloria</i> uiua Myronis' (on Myron's <i>Cow</i> see at
i 34 <i>ut similis uerae uacca Myronis opus</i> [<a href="#Page_158">p 158</a>]).</p>

<p><b>71. SI DARE</b> <i>R. J. Tarrant.</i> The manuscripts' SED DARE is a possible
reading; but Professor Tarrant's slight change removes the awkwardness
of <i>nec tamen</i> following immediately upon <i>sed</i>.</p>

<p><b>71. MAVIS</b> <i>IF<sup>2ul</sup></i> MAIVS <i>BF<sup>1</sup></i>. Either of the two variants could be read
from <i>CMHLT</i>. The preferable reading is <i>mauis</i>, since it links more
closely to <i>potes</i> in the pentameter, and would be especially liable to
corruption after <i>maiora</i> two lines previous. I have found no good
parallel for singular <i>maius</i> 'a more important thing': for the plural
<i>OLD maior</i> 5 cites from verse <i>Fast</i> IV 3 'certe maiora canebas' and
its model, <i>Ecl</i> IV 1 'paulo maiora canamus'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p><b>72. NEC TAMEN EX TOTO DESERERE ILLA POTES.</b> Graecinus was another of
Ovid's addressees who, while a soldier, kept up his other pursuits:
'artibus ingenuis [=<i>l&#299;b&#277;r&#257;libus</i>], quarum tibi maxima cura
est, / pectora mollescunt asperitasque fugit. / nec quisquam meliore
fide complectitur illas, / qua sinit officium militiaeque labor' (<i>EP</i> I
vi 7-10).</p>

<p><b>72. EX TOTO.</b> 'Altogether'. Compare <i>EP</i> I vi 27-28 'spes igitur menti
poenae, Graecine, leuandae / non est <i>ex toto</i> nulla relicta meae'. The
idiom was probably subliterary: the only instances from the time of Ovid
cited by <i>OLD totum</i> 2 are Celsus III 3 71b 'neque <i>ex toto</i> in
remissionem desistit' and Columella V 6 17 'antequam <i>ex toto</i> arbor
praeualescat'.</p>

<p><b>73. NVMERIS ... VERBA COERCES.</b> 'You arrange words in metrical patterns'.
Similar wording at Cic <i>Or</i> 64 'mollis est enim oratio philosophorum
... nec <i>uincta numeris</i> ['not in rhythmic prose'], sed soluta liberius'.</p>

<p>Professor E. Fantham points out to me that Ovid may also be playing on
<i>numerus</i> 'military contingent' (<i>OLD numerus</i> 9): 'you draft words in
squads'.</p>

<p><b>75-76. NEC AD CITHARAM NEC AD ARCVM SEGNIS APOLLO, / SED VENIT AD SACRAS
NERVVS VTERQVE MANVS.</b> Apollo is similarly described at <i>Met</i> X 107-8 (of
Cyparissus) 'nunc arbor, puer ante deo dilectus ab illo / <i>qui citharam
neruis et neruis temperat arcum</i>'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p><b>76. VENIT</b> = <i>conuenit</i>. In Latin verse a simple verb can carry the sense
of any of its compounds, even when this sense is quite different from
the usual meaning of the simple verb. Compare Catullus LXIV 21 'tum
Thetidi pater ipse <i>iugandum</i> Pelea <i>sensit</i>', "where it is plain that
iugandum is for coniugandum, and this leads the reader to the conclusion
that sensit is for consensit, where the omission decidedly affects the
sense" (Bell 330).</p>

<p>The line should not be taken as an instance of the expression <i>uenire ad
manum</i> (<i>OLD uenio</i> 7c), since the idiom's sense 'be convenient' does
not fit the context here: for the sense compare Livy XXXVIII 21 6 'quod
[<i>sc</i> saxum] cuique temere trepidanti <i>ad manum uenisset</i>' and
Quintilian II xi 6 'abrupta quaedam, ut forte <i>ad manum uenere</i>,
iaculantur'. <i>Venire in manus</i> offers a somewhat more satisfactory
meaning, almost equivalent to 'have, hold' (compare Cic <i>Q Fr</i> II xv
[xiv] i 'quicumque calamus <i>in manus meas uenerit</i>' and Persius III 11
'<i>inque manus</i> chartae nodosaque <i>uenit</i> harundo'), but seems to be a
separate idiom.</p>

<p><b>79. QVAE QVONIAM NEC NOS.</b> 'Since she continues to give poetic
inspiration to myself as well as to you'. <i>Quae quoniam</i> seems very
prosaic, but Ovid uses the phrase again at <i>Tr</i> I ix 53-54 '<i>quae</i> [<i>sc</i>
coniectura] <i>quoniam</i> uera est ... gratulor ingenium non latuisse tuum'.</p>

<p><b>79-80. VNDA ... VNGVLA GORGONEI QUAM CAVA FECIT EQVI.</b> Hippocrene, the
spring of the Muses, said to have been created by the hoof-beat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> of
Pegasus. Similarly described at <i>Met</i> V 264 'factas pedis ictibus
undas', <i>Fast</i> V 7-8 'fontes Aganippidos Hippocrenes, / grata Medusaei
signa ... equi' and Persius prol 1 'fonte ... caballino'.</p>

<p><b>80. VNGVLA ... CAVA.</b> Professor J. N. Grant points out to me the possible
borrowing from Ennius <i>Ann</i> 439 Vahlen<sup>3</sup> 'it eques et plausu <i>caua</i>
concutit <i>ungula</i> terram'.</p>

<p><b>80. GORGONEI ... EQVI.</b> The same phrase in the same metrical position at
<i>Fast</i> III 450 'suspice [<i>sc</i> caelum]: <i>Gorgonei</i> colla uidebis <i>equi</i>'.
For the birth of Pegasus from the blood of the Gorgon Medusa, see <i>Met</i>
IV 784-86,</p>

<p><b>81. COMMVNIA SACRA TVERI.</b> <i>Sacra</i> similarly used of poetry at <i>Tr</i> IV i
87, <i>Tr</i> IV x 19 'at mihi iam puero caelestia <i>sacra</i> placebant', <i>EP</i>
II x 17 'sunt tamen inter se <i>communia sacra</i> poetis', and <i>EP</i> III iv
67 'sunt mihi uobiscum <i>communia sacra</i>, poetae'. For <i>tueri</i> 'observe,
maintain' compare Cic <i>Tusc</i> I 2 'mores et instituta uitae resque
domesticas ac familiaris nos profecto et melius <i>tuemur</i> et lautius'.</p>

<p><b>82. ISDEM STVDIIS IMPOSVUISSE MANVM.</b> Similar phrasing at <i>Tr</i> IV i 27-28
'non equidem uellem ... <i>Pieridum sacris imposuisse manum</i>'.</p>

<p><b>82. IMPOSVISSE</b> has the sense of the present infinitive, as is shown by
<i>tueri</i> in the previous line; compare as well ii 27-28 'uix sumptae Musa
tabellae / <i>imponit</i> pigras, paene coacta, <i>manus</i>'. For the idiom, see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Platnauer 109-12. It is particularly frequent in the latter half of the
pentameter, immediately before the disyllable: compare, from many
instances, <i>AA</i> III 431-32 '<i>ire</i> solutis / crinibus et fletus non
<i>tenuisse</i> decet' and <i>Tr</i> IV viii 5-12 'nunc erat ut posito deberem
fine laborum / <i>uiuere</i>, me nullo sollicitante metu, / quaeque meae
semper placuerunt otia menti / <i>carpere</i> et in studiis molliter <i>esse</i>
meis, / et paruam <i>celebrare</i> domum ueteresque Penates ... inque sinu
dominae carisque sodalibus inque / securus patria <i>consenuisse</i> mea'.
The idiom, although more common in elegiac verse, is also found in epic:
compare <i>Aen</i> X 14 'tum <i>certare</i> odiis, tum res <i>rapuisse</i> licebit'.</p>

<p><b>83. LITORA PELLITIS NIMIVM SVBIECTA CORALLIS.</b> Compare ii 37 'hic mea cui
recitem nisi flauis scripta Corallis'. Strabo mentions the Coralli as
inhabiting the region near Haemus (VII 5 12); they are rather obscurely
described at Val Fl VI 89-94 'densique leuant uexilla Coralli, /
barbaricae quis signa rotae, ferrataque dorso / forma suum ['of pigs'],
truncaeque Iouis simulacra columnae; / proelia nec rauco curant
incendere cornu, / indigenas sed rite duces et prisca suorum / facta
canunt ueterumque, uiris hortamina, laudes'.</p>

<p>Nothing else is known of the tribe.</p>

<p><b>83. PELLITIS.</b> Elsewhere in Ovid only at x 2 'pellitos ... Getas'.</p>

<p><b>83. NIMIVM SVBIECTA.</b> Compare vi 45 'nimium nobis conterminus Hister'.</p>

<p><b>85. VLLO</b> <i>M</i> ILLO <i>BCFHILT</i>. <i>Illo</i> is not a possible reading, since of

Tomis. Ovid does not specify a preferred place of exile at either <i>Tr</i>
IV iv 49 'nunc precor hinc alio iubeat discedere' or <i>EP</i> III i 29-30
'non igitur mirum ... altera si nobis usque rogatur humus', nor in any of
the passages listed in the next two notes.</p>

<p><b>86. QVI MINVS ... DISTET.</b> For this constant prayer of the exiled Ovid,
see <i>Tr</i> II 575-78 (the concluding lines) 'non ut in Ausoniam redeam,
nisi forsitan olim, / cum longo poenae tempore uictus eris; / tutius
exilium pauloque quietius oro, / ut par delicto sit mea poena suo',
<i>Ibis</i> 28, <i>EP</i> III i 4 &amp; 85, <i>EP</i> III iii 64, <i>EP</i> III vii 30, <i>EP</i> III
ix 38, and <i>EP</i> III ix 1-4 'Quod sit in his eadem sententia, Brute,

terra fruar ut propiore rogare</i>, / et quam sim denso cinctus ab hoste
loqui'.</p>

<p><b>86. DISTET</b> <i>FHILM<sup>2c</sup></i>. Lenz and Andr&eacute; print DISTAT (<i>BCT</i>); however, the
defining subjunctive seems to be required, and is supported by <i>EP</i> II

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="IX_To_Graecinus" id="IX_To_Graecinus"></a>IX. To Graecinus</h2>


<p>C. Pomponius Graecinus (<i>PIR<sup>1</sup></i> P 540), suffect consul in 16, was the
recipient of <i>EP</i> I vi, an appeal for his assistance, and of <i>EP</i> II vi,
a request that he be more lenient towards Ovid's faults and continue to
assist him. He must have been an old friend of Ovid, for <i>Am</i> II x is
addressed to him ('Tu mihi, tu certe, memini, Graecine, negabas / uno
posse aliquem tempore amare duas'), and he was clearly a literary patron
(<i>EP</i> I vi 7-8 'artibus ingenuis, <i>quarum tibi maxima cura est</i>, /
pectora mollescunt asperitasque fugit').</p>

<p>The poem begins with Ovid's wish that his letter might arrive on the day
Graecinus becomes consul (1-4). He imagines himself present when
Graecinus enters his magistracy; since he will not be there, he will at
least in his mind imagine Graecinus carrying out his consular functions
(5-56). He then speaks of Graecinus' brother Flaccus, who will succeed
him as <i>consul ordinarius</i> for 17: the two brothers will take pleasure
in each other's office (57-65). He describes the brothers' devotion to
Tiberius, and asks for their assistance in obtaining his removal from
Tomis (65-74). The mention of his exile serves as a bridge to the topic
of his life in Tomis. Flaccus can attest to the hardships Ovid endures,
since he was recently stationed in the area (75-86). Once Graecinus has
learned of these hardships from Flaccus, he should ask what Ovid's
reputation in Tomis is. He will learn that Ovid is well liked, and has
even received public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> honours (87-104). His loyalty to the imperial
family is well known: Flaccus may have heard of this, Tiberius will
eventually learn of it, but Augustus has certainly observed it from
heaven; Ovid's poems are perhaps inducing Augustus to yield to his
prayers (105-34).</p>

<p>The poem is the longest in the book, and combines several almost
unrelated sections dealing with a number of subjects. The first section
of the poem, the celebration of Graecinus' nomination to the consulship,
is very heavily indebted to IV iv, Ovid's first poem on Sextus Pompeius'
election to the consulship. The section detailing Flaccus' presence near
Tomis owes something to IV vii, the letter to Vestalis. The description
of Ovid's reputation in Tomis is new, and shows a softening of his
attitude towards his fellow-townsmen, but the description of his piety
to the imperial family owes much to III ii, a letter of thanks to Cotta
for the gift of images of the members of the family. The poem's
discursiveness and large number of derived elements suggest a hasty
composition.</p>

<p><b>1. GRAECINE.</b> Graecinus became a <i>frater Arualis</i> in 21 (<i>CIL</i> VI 2023);
the C. Pomponius Graecinus of <i>CIL</i> XI 5809 (Iguvium) seems not to have
survived to enter the Senate (Syme <i>HO</i> 74-75). Graecinus is not
mentioned in literary sources apart from Ovid, but his brother Flaccus
was rather more famous: see at 75 (<a href="#Page_308">p 308</a>).</p>

<p><b>3. DI FACIANT</b> looks like a colloquial expression. Other instances at iv
47-48 '<i>di faciant</i> aliquo subeat tibi tempore nostrum / nomen', <i>Tr</i> V
xiii 17, and Prop II ix 24.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p><b>3. AVRORAM</b> here is virtually equivalent to <i>diem</i>; it is not found
elsewhere in the poetry of exile, but compare <i>Fast</i> I 461 &amp; II 267-68
'tertia post idus nudos aurora Lupercos / aspicit'.</p>

<p><b>3. OCCVRRAT.</b> 'Arrive', as commonly: compare Cic <i>Phil</i> I 9, Livy XXXVII
50 7 '<i>ad comitiorum tempus occurrere</i> non posse', and Pliny <i>Ep</i> VI
xxxiv 3 'uellem Africanae [<i>sc</i> pantherae] quas coemeras plurimas <i>ad
praefinitum diem occurrissent</i>'.</p>

<p>
<b>4. BIS SENOS</b> = <i>d&#365;&#335;d&#277;cim</i>, metrically difficult because
of its initial three consecutive short vowels.
Roman poets avoid using the usual
names for numbers above <i>nouem</i>, with the obvious exceptions of <i>centum</i>
and <i>mille</i>; sometimes, as here, metrical exigencies left them with no
alternative. For <i>bis seni</i> (<i>sex</i>) Tarrant at Sen <i>Ag</i> 812 <i>bis seno
... labore</i> cites Ennius <i>Ann</i> 323 Vahlen<sup>2</sup>, <i>Ecl</i> I 43, <i>Aen</i> I 393, Prop
II xx 7, <i>Met</i> VIII 243, <i>Fast</i> I 28, Sen <i>Tro</i> 386 &amp; <i>Oed</i> 251, and
from Greek Callimachus <i>Aetia</i> I fr. 23 19 Pfeiffer.</p>

<p><b>6. TVRBAE.</b> Compare iv 27 'cernere iam uideor rumpi paene atria <i>turba</i>'.</p>

<p><b>7. IN DOMINI SVBEAT PARTES.</b> <i>Partes</i> = 'function'; see at ii 27 <i>uix
uenit ad partes ... Musa</i> (<a href="#Page_170">p 170</a>). For <i>subeat</i> 'undertake' compare
Quintilian X i 71 'declamatoribus ... necesse est secundum condicionem
controuersiarum plures <i>subire personas</i>' and the passages cited at <i>OLD
subeo</i> 7b.</p>

<p><b>8. FESTO</b> <i>Burman</i> IVSSO <i>BCMFHIL</i> IVSTO <i>T, sicut coni Merkel</i>. <i>Iusso</i>
has been explained since Merula as meaning that Ovid hopes the letter
will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> arrive on the day it is told to; but the word seems rather
strange, and lacks the point it has in the passages cited by Ehwald
(<i>KB</i> 64), <i>AA</i> II 223-24 'iussus adesse foro, <i>iussa</i> maturius <i>hora</i> /
fac semper uenias, nec nisi serus abi' and Prop IV vi 63-64 (of
Cleopatra) 'illa petit Nilum cumba male nixa fugaci, / hoc unum, <i>iusso</i>
non moritura <i>die</i>' (she would commit suicide at a time of her own
choosing), or at <i>Aen</i> X 444 (cited by Owen in 1894) 'socii cesserunt
<i>aequore iusso</i>', where <i>iusso</i> stands by hypallage for <i>iussi</i>. The
meaning of <i>iusto</i> is inappropriate for the present passage, as will be
seen from Suet <i>Tib</i> 4 2 'retentis ultra <i>iustum tempus</i> ['the time
allowed'] insignibus'. Burman's conjecture <i>festo</i> was not placed in the
text even by its author, but it seems a reasonable solution to the
difficulty. For it Burman cited 56 'hic quoque te <i>festum</i> consule
<i>tempus</i> agam'; see as well <i>Fast</i> I 79-80 'uestibus intactis Tarpeias
itur in arces, / et populus <i>festo</i> concolor ipse suo est'. The
corruption of so straightforward an epithet may seem unlikely, but
compare Prop IV xi 65-66 'uidimus et fratrem sellam geminasse curulem; /
consule quo, <i>festo</i> [<i>Koppiers</i>: facto <i>codd</i>] <i>tempore</i>, rapta soror'.</p>

<p><b>9. ATQVI</b> <i>unus e duobus Hafniensibus Heinsii</i>. The ATQVE of <i>BCMFHILT</i>
is possibly right. For the adversative sense here required, <i>OLD</i>
<i>atque</i> 9 cites Plautus <i>Aul</i> 287-88 '<i>atque ego</i> istuc, Anthrax,
aliouorsum dixeram, / non istuc quod tu insimulas', <i>Mer</i> 742, and Ter
<i>Heaut</i> 189 (apparently a misprint for 187 'atque etiam nunc tempus
est') from comedy, but from the classical period only Cic <i>Att</i> VI i 2
'ac putaram<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span> paulo secus' and <i>Fam</i> XIV iv 5 '<i>atque ego</i>, qui te
confirmo, ipse me non possum', and instances of <i>ac tamen</i> at <i>Fam</i> VII
xxiii 1, Caesar <i>BC</i> III 87 4, and Tac <i>Ann</i> III 72. In view of the
doubtful status of adversative <i>atque</i> at the time of Ovid and the ease
of corruption of <i>atqui</i> to <i>atque</i> I have followed Heinsius in reading
<i>atqui</i>. Heinsius similarly restored <i>atqui</i> from his <i>codex
Richelianus</i> for the other manuscripts' <i>atque</i> at <i>Tr</i> II 121-24
'corruit haec ... sub uno ... crimine lapsa domus. / <i>atqui</i> ea sic lapsa
est ut surgere, si modo laesi / ematuruerit Caesaris ira, queat'; and
<i>atque</i> is found for the correct <i>atqui</i> in some manuscripts at Hor
<i>Sat</i> I ix 52-53 '"magnum narras, uix credibile!" "atqui / sic habet"'
and <i>EP</i> I ii 33-34 '<i>atqui</i> / si noles sanus, curres hydropicus', and
in most manuscripts at <i>Ep</i> I vii 1-5 'Quinque dies tibi pollicitus me
rure futurum / Sextilem totum mendax desideror. <i>atqui</i>, / si me uiuere
uis sanum recteque ualentem, / quam mihi das aegro, dabis aegrotare
timenti, / Maecenas, ueniam'.</p>

<p><b>10. SINCERO.</b> 'Unbroken'.</p>

<p><b>12. SALVTANDI MVNERE ... TVI.</b> Professor R. J. Tarrant points out to me
the notably prosaic use of the defining gerundive.</p>

<p><b>13. GRATATVS</b> has the force of a present participle, as is shown by <i>cum
dulcibus ... uerbis</i>; Andr&eacute; mistranslates 'apr&egrave;s t'avoir f&eacute;licit&eacute;, je
t'embrasserai avec des mots tendres'. The perfect participle of deponent
verbs takes past or present meaning indifferently, according to
context.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p><b>16. VT CAPERET FASTVS VIX DOMVS VLLA MEOS</b> seems strange, as does
N&eacute;methy's explanation 'poeta elatus superbia tectum uertice tangere sibi
uidetur'. Perhaps the distich means something like 'on that day I would
be filled with a pride which no ancestry, no matter how illustrious,
could justify'.</p>

<p><b>16. FASTVS.</b> 'Haughtiness'&mdash;Wheeler. The same sense at <i>AA</i> II 241-42
'exue <i>fastus</i>, / curam mansuri quisquis amoris habes' and <i>Aen</i> III
326-27 (Andromache speaking) 'stirpis Achilleae <i>fastus</i> iuuenemque
superbum ... tulimus'. Ovid generally uses <i>fastus</i> of the arrogance of
women to their suitors (<i>Am</i> II xvii 9, <i>Met</i> XIV 762, <i>Fast</i> I 419);
the word is not found elsewhere in the poetry of exile.</p>

<p><b>17. DVMQVE LATVS SANCTI CINGIT TIBI TVRBA SENATVS.</b> Compare iv 41 'inde
domum repetes toto comitante senatu'; Ovid is here obviously referring
to the earlier procession <i>from</i> the new consul's house.</p>

<p><b>20. LATERIS ... LOCVM</b> is a strange phrase, but is made easier by <i>latus
... cingit</i> in 17. Compare also such passages as <i>Met</i> II 448-49 'nec
... iuncta deae lateri nec toto est agmine prima' and <i>Aen</i> X 160-61
'Pallas ... sinistro / adfixus lateri'. It is possible that <i>latus</i> here
means 'companion', as at Martial VI lxviii 4 'Eutychos ille, tuum,
Castrice, dulce latus'.</p>

<p><b>20. HABVISSE</b> is equivalent to <i>habere</i>, as is shown by <i>esse</i> in the
preceding line. For the idiom, see at viii 82 <i>imposuisse</i> (<a href="#Page_282">p 282</a>) and
xi 2 <i>habuisse</i> (<a href="#Page_361">p 361</a>).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p><b>21. TVRBA QVAMVIS ELIDERER.</b> <i>Elidere</i> similarly used of a crowd's
jostling at Sen <i>Clem</i> I 6 1; an extended description at Juvenal III
243-48.</p>

<p><b>23. PROSPICEREM.</b> Owen in his second edition, Wheeler, and Lenz follow
Ehwald (<i>KB</i> 64) in printing <i>B</i>'s ASPICEREM. Ehwald argued that
<i>prospicerem</i>, 'survey from a distance', was inappropriate in view of
the preceding <i>turba quamuis eliderer</i>. But the verb should be taken not
with the pentameter that precedes, but with the one that follows,
'densaque quam longum turba teneret iter': <i>prospicerem</i> seems very
appropriate. Riese conjectured RESPICEREM 'look back at', but emendation
seems unnecessary.</p>

<p>Compounds of <i>specere</i> (the simple verb is used by Plautus and Ennius)
are peculiarly liable to confusion: <i>prospicere</i> is similarly corrupted
to <i>aspicere</i> in some manuscripts at <i>Met</i> III 603-4 'ipse quid aura
mihi tumulo promittat ab alto / <i>prospicio</i>' and <i>Met</i> XI 715-16 'notata
locis reminiscitur acta fretumque / <i>prospicit</i>', and other instances of
variation of prefix will be found at <i>Met</i> II 405, VI 343, XI 150, XIV
179, XV 577, 660 &amp; 842, <i>Fast</i> I 139 &amp; 461, V 393 &amp; 561, and <i>Her</i> XIX
21.</p>

<p><b>25-26.</b> Heinsius and Bentley questioned the authenticity of these lines,
but the distich does not seem lame enough to warrant excision, and
<i>tegeret</i> (see below) is paralleled elsewhere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p><b>25. QVOQVE MAGIS NORIS.</b> 'Listen: this will make you understand better'.
Ovid is very fond of <i>quoque magis</i> and the corresponding <i>quoque
minus</i>, particularly at line-beginnings. He generally uses the formula
to denote the emotion which information he then gives should induce.
Compare <i>Met</i> I 757-58 '"quo"que "magis doleas, genetrix" ait, "ille ego
liber, / ille ferox tacui"', <i>Met</i> III 448-50 (Narcissus to his
reflection) 'quoque magis doleam, nec nos mare separat ingens ... exigua
prohibemur aqua', <i>Met</i> XIV 695-97 'quoque magis timeas ... referam tota
notissima Cypro / facta', <i>Tr</i> I vii 37-38, and <i>EP</i> I viii 9-10 'quoque
magis nostros uenia dignere libellos, / haec in procinctu carmina facta
leges'; similar instances of <i>quoque minus</i> at <i>Met</i> II 44, VIII 579,
620 &amp; 866, and <i>EP</i> III ii 52. The present passage shows the same idiom,
but with the difference that a subordinate clause (<i>quam me uulgaria
tangant</i>) depends on the verb (<i>noris</i>) introduced by the <i>quoque magis</i>
clause.</p>

<p>The same formula is used with a different sense, the <i>quoque</i> being an
ablative of degree of difference, at <i>Am</i> III ii 28 and <i>Met</i> IV 64
'quoque magis tegitur, tectus magis aestuat ignis'.</p>

<p><i>EP</i> II v 15-16 'quoque magis moueare malis, doctissime, nostris, /
credibile est fieri condicione loci' reads oddly; something has probably
been lost from the text after the hexameter.</p>

<p><b>25. VVLGARIA.</b> 'Commonplace, ordinary'. Compare Hor <i>Sat</i> II ii 38 and
Cic <i>De or</i> II 347 'neque enim paruae [<i>sc</i> res] neque usitatae neque
uulgares admiratione aut omnino laude dignae uideri solent'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p><b>25. TANGANT.</b> 'Impress'; compare <i>Her</i> V 81 'non ego miror opes, nec me
tua regia tangit', <i>Her</i> VI 113, <i>Her</i> VII 11, <i>Met</i> IV 639, <i>Met</i> X
614-15 'nec forma <i>tangor</i> (poteram tamen hac quoque tangi), / sed quod
adhuc puer est: non me mouet ipse, sed aetas', and <i>Fast</i> V 489, as well
as <i>Her</i> XVI 83. For <i>tangere</i> with a neuter plural subject see <i>Aen</i> I
462 'mentem mortalia <i>tangunt</i>'.</p>

<p><b>26. TEGERET.</b> There are twenty trisyllabic pentameter endings in
Tibullus, thirty in Propertius, but only five in Ovid, all in the <i>Ex
Ponto</i>: I i 66 <i>faciet</i>, I vi 26 <i>scelus est</i>, I viii 40 <i>liceat</i>, III
vi 46 <i>uideor</i>, and this passage (Platnauer 15-16). Quadrisyllabic
endings are similarly frequent in the poetry of exile: see at ii 10
<i>Alcinoo</i> (<a href="#Page_164">p 164</a>).</p>

<p><b>27. SIGNA ... IN SELLA ... FORMATA CVRVLI.</b> For <i>signum</i> 'bas-relief' see
at v 18 <i>conspicuum signis ... ebur</i> (the phrase also of the curule
chair).</p>

<p><b>28. NVMIDAE SCVLPTILE DENTIS OPVS.</b> Professor R. J. Tarrant points out to
me the clear imitation of Prop II xxxi 12 'ualuae, Llbyci nobile dentis
opus'.</p>

<p><b>28. NVMIDAE ... DENTIS</b> <i>edd</i> NVMIDI ... DENTIS <i>codd</i>. The masculine first
declension substantive <i>Numida</i> is occasionally used as an adjective:
compare <i>AA</i> II 183 'Numidasque leones' (some manuscripts read
<i>Numidosque</i>) and Juvenal IV 99-100 'ursos ... Numidas'. Andr&eacute; prints
<i>Numidi</i>, citing a nominative <i>Numidus</i> at <i>CIL</i> VIII 17328, the
variant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> at <i>AA</i> II 183, and Apicius VI 8 4 'pullum Numidum' (where
there is a variant <i>Numidicum</i>, which Andr&eacute; printed in his 1974 edition
of Apicius). But given the support for the first-declension form offered
by the Juvenal passage and the better manuscripts of the <i>Ars Amatoria</i>,
the danger in adducing a doubtful passage of Apicius and a single
inscription to determine poetic usage, and the ease of corruption to the
second declension, it seems better to assume that Ovid here used the
first declension form.</p>

<p><i>Numidae ... dentis</i> is high poetic diction: compare <i>Met</i> XI 167-68
'instructam ... fidem gemmis et <i>dentibus Indis</i>', Catullus LXIV 47-48
'puluinar ... <i>Indo</i> ... <i>dente</i> politum', Prop II xxxi 12 (quoted above),
and Statius <i>Sil</i> III iii 94-95 'Indi / dentis honos'.</p>

<p><b>28. SCVLPTILE.</b> The word does not seem to occur again in Latin until
Prudentius <i>Steph</i> X 266.</p>

<p><b>29. TARPEIAS ... IN ARCES.</b> See at iv 29 <i>Tarpeiae ... sedis</i> (<a href="#Page_208">p 208</a>).</p>

<p><b>30. DVM</b> expresses purpose; if it were temporal, the verb would be
<i>cadit</i> instead of <i>caderet</i>: compare 17-18 '<i>dumque</i> latus sancti
<i>cingit</i> tibi turba senatus, / consulis ante pedes ire iuberer eques'.</p>

<p><b>31. SECRETO</b> represents Ovid's response to the bidding <i>fauete linguis</i>.
The word is frequent in comedy, but is very rare in verse, being
virtually confined to satire (Hor <i>Sat</i> I ix 67, Juvenal I 95).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p><b>31-32. MAGNVS ... DEVS</b> = Iuppiter Optimus <i>Maximus</i>. Compare <i>AA</i> II 540
'eris <i>magni</i> uictor in arce <i>Iouis</i>'.</p>

<p><b>33. TVRAQVE MENTE MAGIS PLENA QVAM LANCE DEDISSEM.</b> The same notion of
sincerity of feeling being more important than size of gifts at viii
35-40.</p>

<p><b>34. TER QVATER ... LAETVS.</b> 'Infinitely happy'; compare Prop III xii 15
'<i>ter quater</i> in casta felix, o Postume, Galla!', <i>Aen</i> I 94 'o <i>terque
quaterque</i> beati', <i>AA</i> II 447-48, and <i>Tr</i> III xii 25-26 'o <i>quater</i> et
<i>quotiens non est numerare beatum</i> / non interdicta cui licet urbe
frui!'. The phrase is common in Ovid, but he generally uses it to mean
'several times': compare <i>Am</i> III i 31-32 'mouit ... <i>terque quaterque</i>
caput', <i>Met</i> II 49, <i>Met</i> IV 734 '<i>ter quater</i> exegit repetita per ilia
ferrum', <i>Met</i> VI 133, <i>Met</i> IX 217, <i>Met</i> XII 288, <i>Fast</i> I 576, and
<i>Fast</i> I 657 '<i>ter quater</i> euolui signantes tempora fastos'.</p>

<p><b>35. HIC.</b> 'Hier auf dem Kapitol'&mdash;Ehwald (<i>KB</i> 65). The idiom is somewhat
strange, but seems well enough supported by <i>Met</i> XIV 372-73 '"per o,
tua lumina" dixit / "quae mea ceperunt, perque <i>hanc</i>, pulcherrime,
formam"' and <i>Her</i> XVI 137, passages cited by R, J. Tarrant at Sen <i>Ag</i>
971 'dummodo <i>hac</i> ['your'] moriar manu'. Compare as well Prop I xi
17-18 'non quia perspecta non es mihi cognita fama, / sed quod in <i>hac</i>
omnis <i>parte</i> ['at Baiae'] timetur [<i>codd</i>: ueretur <i>Lachmann</i>] amor'
and Fedeli <i>ad loc</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p><b>36. MITIA ... SI ... FATA DARENT.</b> 'If the Fates had been kind, and given'.</p>

<p><b>36. VRBIS</b> <i>editio Aldina 1502</i> VERBIS <i>codd</i>. <i>Ius urbis</i> = <i>ius urbis
habitandae</i>; compare <i>Met</i> XIII 471-72 'genetrici corpus inemptum /
reddite, neue auro redimat ius triste sepulcri [=<i>sepeliendi</i>]'.</p>

<p><b>37-38. MENTE ... OCVLIS.</b> Similarly contrasted at <i>Met</i> XV 62-64 'isque,
licet caeli regione remotos, / <i>mente</i> deos adiit et, quae natura
negarat [<i>'Medic. rectius' (Heinsius)</i>: negabat <i>codd</i>] / uisibus
humanis, <i>oculis</i> ea <i>pectoris</i> hausit'.</p>

<p><b>38. NON ITA CAELITIBVS VISVM EST.</b> 'The gods decided otherwise'. Compare
xi 7 'non ita dis placuit', <i>Met</i> VII 699, <i>Tr</i> IV viii 15-16 (Ovid had
hoped for a peaceful and happy old age) 'non ita dis uisum est, qui me
terraque marique / actum Sarmaticis exposuere locis'. These passages are
probably all echoes of <i>Aen</i> II 426 'dis aliter uisum'.</p>

<p><b>40. IVVET</b> <i>B<sup>pc</sup>CMFHILT</i> FORET <i>B<sup>ac</sup> 'unde uerum eliciendum'&mdash;Riese</i>. But
the correction is by the original hand (Owen suggested that the error
was induced by <i>foret</i> at the end of the preceding distich), and <i>iuuet</i>
is unobjectionable: Ovid is explaining his admission in the previous
line that the gods were perhaps just in his case&mdash;claiming he was
innocent, that is, that the gods had been unjust, would be of no
assistance to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p><b>41. MENTE TAMEN, QVAE SOLA DOMO NON EXVLAT, VSVS.</b> See at iv 45 <i>qua
possum, mente</i> (<a href="#Page_211">p 211</a>).</p>

<p><b>41. QVAE SOLA DOMO NON EXVLAT.</b> Similar wording at <i>Tr</i> III iv 45-46
'Nasonisque tui <i>quod adhuc non exulat unum</i> / nomen ama'.</p>

<p><b>41. DOMO NON EXVLAT.</b> <i>Domo</i> is my conjecture for the transmitted LOCO,
which is strange and difficult to construe. FOCO is also possible; but
the singular would be unusual. For <i>domo</i> compare Ter <i>Eun</i> 610 'domo
exulo nunc'.</p>

<p><b>42. PRAETEXTAM FASCES ASPICIAMQVE.</b> The <i>-que</i> logically belongs with
<i>fasces</i>, joining it with <i>praetextam</i>: such dislocations are common in
the pentameter because of its strict metrical requirements.</p>

<p>According to the manuscripts the preceding line ends with VTAR; I have
printed Heinsius' VSVS, since there would otherwise be an asyndeton
between <i>utar</i> and <i>aspiciam</i>. There are similar errors at 57 and xi 15
(<i>cedet</i> for <i>cedens</i>; <i>peruenit</i> for <i>perueniens</i>): here we may have a
deliberate alteration by a scribe who did not understand the force of
the delayed enclitic and sought a verb to couple <i>aspiciam</i> with.</p>

<p><b>44. DECRETIS</b> <i>Korn</i> SECRETIS <i>codd</i> SECRETO <i>Wheeler</i>. Korn's conjecture
makes the pentameter an amplification of the hexameter, a common pattern
in Ovid; its corruption to <i>secretis</i> would be easy. Ehwald (<i>KB</i> 39-40)
retained <i>secretis</i>, citing Tac <i>Ann</i> III 37 '<i>secreta</i> ['solitary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
designs'&mdash;Grant] patris mitigari' and Pliny <i>Pan</i> 53 6 (we should
rejoice in our present good fortune under Trajan, and weep at the
tribulations endured under previous emperors) 'hoc <i>secreta</i> nostra
['our private thoughts'], hoc sermones, hoc ipsae gratiarum actiones
agant'. But in a list of the consul's public functions such a deviation
of subject seems inappropriate. Wheeler's <i>secreto</i> is a little forced:
'my mind ... shall fancy itself present unseen at your actions'. Ehwald
objected that Korn did not explain what his conjecture meant; but
<i>decernere</i> was used of the consuls' judicial decisions (Cic <i>Att</i> XVI
xvi a 4(6) 'consulum decretum').</p>

<p><b>45. LONGI ... LVSTRI.</b> The epithet seems to have no special force: compare
iv 23 'longum ... annum'.</p>

<p><b>45. REDITVS HASTAE SVPPONERE.</b> See at v 19 <i>reditus ... componet</i> (<a href="#Page_219">p 219</a>).</p>

<p><b>46. CERNET</b> <i>PM<sup>2c</sup>, Gothanus membr. II 121 (saec xiii)</i> CREDET <i>BCFHILT</i>.
<i>Cernet</i> seems preferable to <i>credet</i> as continuing the image of
<i>uidebit</i> in 43.</p>

<p><b>46. EXACTA CVNCTA LOCARE FIDE.</b> Graecinus will be careful and
incorruptible in assigning taxation contracts. For <i>fide</i> compare v 20
'et minui magnae non sinet urbis opes'; for <i>exacta</i> compare Suet <i>Tib</i>
18 'cum animaduerteret Varianam cladem temeritate et neglegentia ducis

<p><b>48. PVBLICA QVAERENTEM QVID PETAT VTILITAS.</b> The consul acted as chairman
of the Senate, proposing the order of the day, and asking the senators
in order of seniority for their <i>sententiae</i> on the appropriate action
for the question under discussion.</p>

consulere quam uoluntati', and Livy VI 40 5 &amp; VIII 34 2 'posthabita
filii caritas <i>publicae utilitati</i>'.</p>

<p><b>49. PRO CAESARIBVS</b> = <i>pro Caesarum factis</i>. Compare <i>Res Gestae</i> 4 'ob

<p><b>49. DECERNERE GRATES.</b> 'Propose (in the Senate) the decreeing of thanks'.
The sense of <i>decernere</i> is common in prose: see Cic <i>Prou Cons</i> 1,
<i>Att</i> VII i 7, and the other passages at <i>OLD decerno</i> 6.</p>

<p><b>49. GRATES</b> appears occasionally in prose (Tarrant at Sen <i>Ag</i> 380
<i>reddunt grates</i> cites Livy XXIII 11 12, Curtius IX 6 17, and Vell Pat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
II 25 4), but in hexameter and elegiac verse is the necessary
representative for <i>gr&#257;t&#301;&#257;s</i>.</p>

<p><b>51. CVM IAM FVERIS POTIORA PRECATVS.</b> For <i>potior</i> 'more important'
compare Caesar <i>BC</i> I 8 (a reported remark of Pompey) 'semper se rei
publicae commoda priuatis necessitudinibus habuisse <i>potiora</i>', Livy
VIII 29 2, and the many passages at <i>OLD potior<sup>2</sup></i> 4. The usage belongs
to prose: Ovid elsewhere and Virgil always use <i>potior</i> to mean either
'more powerful' or 'preferable'.</p>

<p><b>53-54. SVRGAT ... DETQVE.</b> The apodosis of an implied condition: 'If you
prayed for me, the fire would rise'.</p>

<p><b>53. SVRGAT AD HANC VOCEM PLENA PIVS IGNIS AB ARA.</b> The same favourable
omen at <i>Met</i> X 278-79 (Pygmalion has finished his prayer to Venus)
'amici numinis omen, / flamma ter accensa est apicemque per aera duxit'.</p>

<p><b>53. PLENA ... AB ARA.</b> Another indication of Graecinus' devotion to the
Caesars.</p>

<p><b>53. PIVS.</b> 'Holy'; compare <i>pia tura</i> at <i>Am</i> III iii 33, <i>Met</i> XI 577,
and <i>Tr</i> II 59, <i>pia sacra</i> at <i>Tr</i> V v 2, and <i>pio ... igne</i> at <i>Tr</i> V v
12.</p>

<p><b>54. LVCIDVS.</b> Proleptic: 'The flame-tips would become bright and furnish
a good omen for your prayer'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p><b>55. NE CVNCTA QVERAMVR.</b> 'So that not everything I say will be a
complaint'.</p>

<p><b>57. LAETITAE EST</b> <i>LT</i>. Most manuscripts have LAETITIA EST. Similarly at
<i>Met</i> VIII 430 'illi <i>laetitiae est</i> cum munere muneris auctor' most
codices read <i>laetitia est</i>. Heinsius thought LAETITIAE possibly correct
here, as might be the case also in the <i>Metamorphoses</i>: <i>laetitiae</i>
could easily have been misread as <i>laetitia &#275;</i> [=<i>est</i>], with
<i>laetitiae est</i> as a later correction.</p>

<p><b>58. FRATER.</b> L. Pomponius Flaccus (<i>PIR<sup>1</sup></i> P 538), <i>consul ordinarius</i> for
17. As the greater honour would indicate (Graecinus was <i>consul
suffectus</i>), Flaccus was more prominent than his brother and, unlike
Graecinus, is several times mentioned in literary sources outside Ovid.
At II 129 Velleius Paterculus speaks of Flaccus' ability and modesty,
and Suetonius (<i>Tib</i> 42 1) names him as a drinking-companion of the
emperor, made propraetor of Syria by Tiberius. Tacitus says that Flaccus
proposed the <i>supplicationum dies</i> following the discovery in 16 of
Libo's plot against Tiberius (<i>Ann</i> II 32 3); at <i>Ann</i> II 41 2 he names
Flaccus as consul at the time of Germanicus' great triumph in 17, and at
VI 27 3 mentions Flaccus' death in 34 while propraetor of Syria. For
Flaccus' special mission to Thrace shortly after the time this poem was
written, see at 75 (<a href="#Page_308">p 308</a>).</p>

<p><i>EP</i> I x is addressed to Flaccus, but gives little information except
that Flaccus had, like Graecinus, given help to Ovid (37-40).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span> Ovid's
relations with Flaccus were clearly not as intimate as those with his
brother.</p>

<p><b>59-60.</b> The distich may be an interpolation, or at least deeply corrupted
in its present form. Professor E. Fantham points out to me that the
construction of <i>die</i> with both <i>summo ... Decembri</i> and <i>Iani</i> is
awkward, and that <i>dies Iani</i> does not seem to be used elsewhere in
Latin literature. The tense of <i>suspicit</i> is strange as well: a future
would normally be expected here.</p>

<p><b>61. QVAEQVE EST IN VOBIS PIETAS.</b> 'Your family-feeling is so great that
...' The same idiom at <i>Met</i> V 373 'quae iam patientia nostra est',
<i>EP</i> I vii 59, <i>EP</i> II ii 21-22 'quaeque tua est pietas in totum nomen
Iuli, / te laedi cum quis laeditur inde [=<i>ex illis</i>] putas', and Hor
<i>Sat</i> I ix 54-55 'quae tua uirtus, / expugnabis'. The sense is frequent
in prose (<i>OLD qui<sup>1</sup></i> A 12).</p>

<p>The expression is used as a simple relative with the implication of size
only from context at <i>Tr</i> III v 29 'quaeque tibi linguae est facundia,
confer in illud' and <i>Tr</i> III vi 7-8 'quique est in caris animi [<i>codd</i>:
animo <i>fort legendum; uide ad 91</i>] tibi candor amicis&mdash; / cognitus est
illi quem colis ipse uiro'.</p>

<p><b>61-62. ALTERNA ... GAVDIA.</b> Flaccus will first rejoice to see Graecinus
become consul; then Graecinus will have the pleasure of seeing Flaccus
consul.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p><b>64. BINVS</b> seems sufficiently confirmed, as Ehwald points out (<i>KB</i>
51-52) by <i>bis ... bis</i> in the preceding line; BIMVS, conjectured by
Heinsius and found in certain late manuscripts, seems ingenious but
unnecessary. Ehwald compares <i>Ecl</i> III 30 '<i>bis</i> uenit ad mulctram,
<i>binos</i> alit ubere fetus'.</p>

<p><b>64-65. HONOR ... INGENS.</b> At vii 17 Ovid calls the rank of <i>primipilaris</i>
'titulus ... ingens'.</p>

<p><b>65-66. MARTIA ... ROMA.</b> The same phrase at <i>Tr</i> III vii 52 and <i>EP</i> I
viii 24; compare as well <i>Aen</i> I 276-77 'Romulus ... Mauortia condet /
moenia'. Mars, father of Romulus and Remus, was peculiarly the god of
Rome: compare <i>Fast</i> I 39-40 &amp; III 85-86 'Mars Latio uenerandus erat,
quia praesidet armis: / arma ferae genti remque decusque dabant'.</p>

<p>The reference to Mars is very apt in view of the primarily military
nature of the republican consul's office.</p>

<p><b>67. MVLTIPLICAT TAMEN HVNC GRAVITAS AVCTORIS HONOREM.</b> Flaccus had been
nominated for the consulship by Tiberius.</p>

<p>For language and sentiment compare <i>Met</i> VIII 430 'illi laetitiae est
cum munere muneris <i>auctor</i>'.</p>

<p><b>67. GRAVITAS</b> is linked with Hercules at <i>Met</i> IX 270, with Jupiter at
<i>Met</i> I 207 (considered suspect by Merkel) and II 847, with all the
Olympian gods at <i>Met</i> VI 73, and with Augustus at <i>Tr</i> II 512.
Underneath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> the ostensible connection to Jupiter at <i>Met</i> II 846-47 'non
bene conueniunt nec in una sede morantur / maiestas et amor' Professor
R. J. Tarrant sees an allusion to Augustus.</p>

<p><b>69-70. IVDICIIS IGITVR LICEAT FLACCOQVE TIBIQVE / TALIBVS AVGVSTI TEMPVS
IN OMNE FRVI.</b> Compare <i>EP</i> II vi 17-18 (to Graecinus) 'quodque soles
animo <i>semper</i>, quod uoce precari, / omnia Caesaribus sic <i>tua facta
probes</i>'.</p>

<p><b>70. AVGVSTI</b> = <i>Tiberii</i>;
his name in inscriptions is TI&middot;CAESAR&middot;AVG (Sandys 235).</p>

<p><b>71. CVM</b> <i>FILT</i> QVOD <i>BC</i> VT <i>MH</i> QVVM <i>Weise</i>. The archetype was
illegible at this point, and the manuscripts offer various supplements.
Of these <i>cum</i> seems the most appropriate. Ehwald favoured <i>quod</i> (<i>KB</i>
48), but all except one of the passages he cited are instances of <i>quod
superest</i> or <i>quod reliquum est</i>. The one relevant passage he cited was
<i>Fast</i> II 17-18 (to Augustus) 'ergo ades et placido paulum mea munera
uultu / respice, pacando <i>si quid</i> ab hoste <i>uacat</i>'. Many manuscripts
however offer <i>uacas</i> (for which compare Prop II xxxii 7 'quodcumque
uacabis'), and the corruption to the third person seems an easy one.
<i>Vacare</i> in general does not seem to occur with an expressed impersonal
subject.</p>

<p><b>71. CVRA PROPIORE.</b> The same phrase at <i>Met</i> XIII 578-79 '<i>cura</i> deam
<i>propior</i> luctusque domesticus angit / Memnonis amissi'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p><b>73. SI QVAE DABIT AVRA SINVM.</b> 'If some wind should give the opportunity
of filling my sails'. <i>Quae</i> is my correction for QVA (<i>CMFHIL</i>), which
would make the sentence mean 'If the wind should in some way ...'. The
difficulty here is with the apparently already existing <i>aura</i>: what
breeze is Ovid referring to? QVEM (<i>BT</i>) presents the same difficulty
('If the breeze should offer any opportunity ...') and in any case looks
like a scribal correction. I take <i>qua</i> to be an unmetrical form
corrupted from the rare form <i>quae</i> of the indefinite adjective. For the
form, compare Ter <i>Heaut</i> 44 'si <i>quae</i> [<i>Bembinus (saec iv-v)</i>: qua
<i>recc</i>] [<i>sc</i> fabula] laboriosast, ad me curritur', Hor <i>Sat</i> I iv 93-95
'mentio si <i>quae</i> [<i>uar</i> qua] ... te coram fuerit, defendas, ut tuus est
mos', Hor <i>Sat</i> II vi 10 'o si urnam argenti fors <i>quae</i> mihi monstret',
and <i>CIL</i> I 583 37 'SEIQVAE CAVSA ERIT'. <i>Quae</i> in the present passage
offers the same notion of a fresh breeze rising as is found at viii
27-28 'quamlibet exigua si nos ea [<i>sc</i> ara] iuuerit <i>aura</i>, / obruta de
mediis cumba resurget aquis' and <i>Tr</i> IV v 19-20 'remis ad opem luctare
ferendam / <i>dum ueniat</i> placido mollior <i>aura</i> deo'.</p>

<p><i>Quae</i> should possibly be written at <i>Met</i> VI 231-33 'praescius imbris
... rector / carbasa deducit ne <i>qua</i> leuis effluat aura', but Professor
R. J. Tarrant points out that <i>qua</i> can be defended by taking <i>leuis</i> to
mean 'nimble', a sense supported here by <i>effluat</i>. A strong case could
be made for reading <i>quae</i> at Hor <i>Carm</i> III xiv 19-20 'Spartacum si
<i>qua</i> potuit uagantem / fallere testa'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p><b>73. SINVM.</b> <i>Sinus</i> in the sense of 'sail' is common enough (<i>Am</i> II xi
38, <i>AA</i> III 500, <i>Fast</i> V 609, and <i>Aen</i> III 455 &amp; V 16; the origin of
the metonymy seen at Prop III ix 30 'uelorum plenos ... sinus'); but the
brachylogy here 'opportunity of filling my sails' is remarkable.</p>

<p><b>73. LAXATE</b> <i>editio princeps Romana</i> IACTATE <i>codd</i>. Korn, Lenz, and
Andr&eacute; print the manuscript reading, and Korn offers three parallel
passages in its defence, none of which stands up to examination. The
first is <i>EP</i> III ii 5-6 'cumque labent alii <i>iactataque</i> uela
relinquant, / tu lacerae remanes ancora sola rati', where <i>iactata</i>
means 'storm-whipped'; compare Statius <i>Theb</i> VII 139-41 'uento /
incipiente ... laxi <i>iactantur</i> ubique rudentes'. At Cic <i>Tusc</i> V 40 (a
Spartan to a wealthy sea-merchant) 'non sane optabilis quidem ista
... rudentibus apta fortuna', 'Well, your fortune depends on your cables,
and I don't think it something to be sought for', <i>iactare</i> does not
appear. The third passage, Virgil <i>G</i> II 354-55 'seminibus positis
superest diducere terram / saepius ad capita ['roots'] et duros
<i>iactare</i> bidentis', hardly seems relevant.</p>

<p>For <i>laxate rudentes</i> 'let out the sails' Heinsius cited <i>Aen</i> III
266-67 'tum litore funem / deripere excussosque iubet <i>laxare</i> rudentis'
'Next he commanded us to fling hawsers from moorings and uncoil and ease
the sheets' (Jackson Knight), <i>Aen</i> VIII 707-8 'uentis ... uela dare et
<i>laxos</i> iamiamque immittere funis', Cic <i>Diu</i> I 127, Lucan V 426-27
'pariter soluere rates, totosque rudentes / <i>laxauere</i> sinus', and Lucan
IX 1004.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p><b>74. E STYGIIS ... AQVIS.</b> Similar phrasing at <i>Met</i> X 697 'Stygia ... unda,
<i>Met</i> XI 500 'Stygia ... unda', <i>Aen</i> VI 374 'Stygias ... aquas', <i>Aen</i>
XII 91 'Stygia ... unda', and <i>Cons Liu</i> 410 'Stygia ... aqua'.</p>

<p>Ovid often uses the phrasing of his exile: see <i>Tr</i> I ii 65-66 'mittere
me <i>Stygias</i> si iam uoluisset in <i>undas</i> / Caesar, in hoc uestro non
eguisset ope', <i>Tr</i> IV v 22, <i>EP</i> I viii 27 'careo uobis, <i>Stygias</i>
detrusus in <i>oras</i>', and <i>EP</i> II iii 44 'a <i>Stygia</i> quantum mors
[<i>codd</i>: sors <i>Heinsius</i>] mea distat aqua?'. For Ovid's exile as the
equivalent of death, see at vi 49 <i>qui me doluistis ademptum</i> (<a href="#Page_243">p 243</a>).</p>

<p><b>75. PRAEFVIT HIS ... LOCIS MODO FLACCVS.</b> At <i>Ann</i> II 64-67 Tacitus
reports how, following the death of Augustus, Rhescuporis attacked and
imprisoned his brother Cotys (addressee of <i>EP</i> II ix), alleging a plot
against himself; on their father's death, the kingdom of Thrace had been
divided between them, Cotys receiving the better regions. Tiberius
insisted that Rhescuporis release his brother and come to Rome to
explain the situation; Rhescuporis then killed his brother, claiming it
was a suicide. 'nec tamen Caesar placitas semel artes mutauit, sed
defuncto Pandusa, quem sibi infensum Rhescuporis arguerat [<i>scripsi</i>:
arguebat <i>M</i>], Pomponium Flaccum, <i>ueterem stipendiis</i> et arta cum rege
amicitia eoque accommodatiorem ad fallendum ob id maxime Moesiae
praefecit'; the previous service mentioned by Tacitus is no doubt the
command Ovid is here referring to.</p>

<p>Flaccus succeeded in trapping Rhescuporis and bringing him to Rome; he
was found guilty and sent in exile to Alexandria, where he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> died.
Velleius Paterculus placed the episode first in his list of memorable
events of Tiberius' reign (II 129); it is briefly mentioned at Suet
<i>Tib</i> 37 4.</p>

<p><b>75. FLACCVS.</b> 'Ab hoc Flacco uolunt quidam Valachiam ['Wallachia'] fuisse
dictam olim <i>Flacciam</i>, quod nomen sensim corruptela sermonis transiit
in Valachiam. Vide Georgii a ['von'] Reychersdorff Chorographiam
Transyluaniae. pag. 33 [first published in 1595; see <i>British Museum Gen
Cat</i> 200 383] qui addit hinc [<i>sic</i>] adhuc Romanum ibi sermonem durare,
licet admodum corruptum. sed hae fabulae'&mdash;Burman. Clearly the existence
of Rumanian was not widely known in Western Europe at the time Burman
wrote.</p>

<p><b>77. MYSAS GENTES</b> = <i>Moesos</i>. Strabo (VII 3 10; cited by Andr&eacute;) claims a
common origin for the &#924;&#959;&#953;&#963;&#959;&#943; of Europe and the &#924;&#965;&#963;&#959;&#943; of Asia.
For the Greek form, compare Ovid's use of <i>Getes</i> for <i>Geta</i>
and <i>Sauromates</i> for <i>Sarmata</i>.</p>

<p><b>78. ARCV FISOS ... GETAS.</b> For the bow as the typical Getic weapon, see
iii 52 'arcu ... Gete", <i>EP</i> III v 45 'Getico ... arcu' and <i>Ibis</i> 635
'Geticasque sagittas'.</p>

<p><b>78. ENSE.</b> The <i>gladius</i>, typical weapon of the Roman legionary. For the
precise equivalence of the two terms, see Quintilian X i 11. In Ovid's
poetry, the proportion of instances of <i>ensis</i> to instances of <i>gladius</i>
is about 90:30; in the poetry of exile, it is 21:3.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> For a discussion of
<i>ensis</i>/<i>gladius</i>, with statistics, see Axelson 51; the only poets to
admit <i>gladius</i> more freely than Ovid are Lucan and Juvenal.</p>

<p><b>79. TROESMIN</b> <i>Heinsius</i> TROESMEN <i>C</i> TROESENEN <i>B<sup>1</sup></i> TROEZEN <i>uel similia
codd plerique</i>. Troesmis, the modern Gala&#355;i, is located on the north
bank of the Danube, about 160 kilometres inland from Aegissos (Tulcea).
Heinsius did not have the assistance of <i>CIL</i> V 6183-88 &amp; 6195, but
seems nonetheless to have conjectured that <i>Troesmin</i> was a possible
reading ('sed legendum, &#932;&#961;&#969;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#8054;&#962; uel &#932;&#961;&#969;&#963;&#956;&#943;&#962;'). Korn
was the first to place <i>Troesmin</i> in the text.</p>

<p><b>79. CELERI VIRTVTE.</b> 'With a bold surprise attack'.</p>

<p><b>80. INFECITQVE FERO SANGVINE DANVVIVM.</b> Compare the similar description
of Vestalis' recapture of Aegissos: 'non negat hoc <i>Hister</i>, cuius tua
dextera quondam / <i>puniceam Getico sanguine fecit aquam</i>' (vii 19-20).</p>

<p><b>80. DANVVIVM.</b> According to Owen at <i>Tr</i> II 192 this, and not DANVBIVM
(the reading of the manuscripts), is the spelling certified by the
inscriptions. Manuscripts divide between the two spellings at Hor <i>Carm</i>
IV xv 21 and Tac <i>Germ</i> I 1.</p>

<p><b>81-86.</b> Ovid similarly calls Vestalis as his witness at vii 3-4 'aspicis
en praesens quali iaceamus in aruo, / nec me testis eris falsa solere
queri'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p><b>81. INCOMMODA.</b> The word is not found elsewhere in Ovid, and is not used
in verse, except for satire (Hor <i>AP</i> 169; Juvenal XIII 21). It is
particularly common in Caesar.</p>

<p><b>81. CAELI</b> = 'climate', as commonly (<i>Tr</i> III iii 7, Prop II xxviii 5,
Cic <i>Att</i> XI xxii 2).</p>

<p><b>82. QVAM VICINO TERREAR HOSTE ROGA.</b> An imitation of Tib I i 3 'quem
labor assiduus <i>uicino terreat hoste</i>'.</p>

<p><b>83. SINTNE LITAE TENVES SERPENTIS FELLE SAGITTAE.</b> Similar descriptions
of poisoned arrows at <i>Tr</i> IV i 77 'imbuta ... tela uenenis', <i>Tr</i> IV i
84, <i>Tr</i> III x 64, <i>Tr</i> V vii 16 'tela ... uipereo lurida felle', <i>EP</i> I
ii 16 'omnia uipereo spicula felle linunt', <i>EP</i> III i 26, and <i>EP</i> III
iii 106.</p>

<p><b>84. FIAT AN HVMANVM VICTIMA DIRA CAPVT.</b> Human sacrifice similarly
mentioned at <i>Tr</i> IV iv 61-62 'illi quos audis hominum gaudere cruore, /
paene sub eiusdem sideris axe iacent'.</p>

<p><b>85. MENTIAR.</b> Professor J. N. Grant points out to me the asyndeton
following <i>quaere ... sintne</i>. Compare the similar problem at iv 31-32.</p>

<p><b>85. AN COEAT DVRATVS FRIGORE PONTVS.</b> Similar wording at vii 7 'ipse
uides certe glacie concrescere Pontum', <i>Tr</i> II 196 'maris astricto quae
coit unda gelu', and <i>Tr</i> III x 37.</p>

<p><b>86. IVGERA MVLTA FRETI.</b> According to <i>TLL</i> VII.2 629 7-8 this is the
unique instance of <i>iugerum</i> being applied to water. The transferred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
sense is natural enough in view of the poets' application to the sea of
such words as <i>campus</i> and <i>arua</i>.</p>

<p><b>89. NON SVMVS ... ODIO.</b> Basically a prose use; but compare <i>Met</i> II 438
'huic odio nemus est', <i>Fast</i> VI 558, <i>EP</i> II i 4 'iam minus hic odio
est quam fuit ante locus', and <i>Ecl</i> VIII 33 'tibi est odio mea
fistula'.</p>

<p>Owen's second edition has the misprint '<i>nec</i> sumus hic odio',
reproduced by Wheeler. The error was induced by <i>nec</i> at the start of
the pentameter.</p>

<p><b>90. NEC CVM FORTVNA MENS QVOQVE VERSA MEA EST.</b> For Ovid's use of
syllepsis, see at vi 16 <i>spem nostram terras deseruitque simul</i> (<a href="#Page_234">p 234</a>).
For the sentiment of this line, compare Sen <i>Med</i> 176 'Fortuna opes
auferre, non animum potest', where Costa cites Accius 619-20 Ribbeck<sup>2</sup>
'nam si a me regnum Fortuna atque opes / eripere quiuit, at uirtutem non
quiit', Sen <i>Ben</i> IV 10 5, Sen <i>Ep</i> XXXVI 6, and Euripides fr. 1066
Nauck.</p>

<p><b>91. ILLA QVIES ANIMO.</b> <i>Animo</i> is locative; or perhaps <i>in</i> should be
supplied from the following line: for the joining of a noun with a
following preposition already with a complement, see Clausen on Persius
I 131 'abaco numeros et secto in puluere metas'. I read <i>animo</i> (found
in one of Heinsius' Vatican manuscripts) because of the parallel
structure it gives with the following <i>in ore</i>, but ANIMI (<i>BCMFHILT</i>)
is possible enough: <i>OLD quies</i> 7 cites <i>quies animi</i> at Celsus III 18
5.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p><b>91. QVAM TV LAVDARE SOLEBAS.</b> The same phrase at <i>Her</i> XV 193 'haec sunt
illa [<i>sc</i> pectora], Phaon, <i>quae tu laudare solebas</i>'. For the
persistence of Ovid's old habits, compare <i>EP</i> I x 29-30 (he remains a
moderate drinker, as formerly).</p>

<p><b>93-94. SIC EGO SVM LONGE, SIC HIC, VBI BARBARVS HOSTIS / VT FERA PLVS
VALEANT LEGIBVS ARMA, FACIT</b> is clearly corrupt, as will be seen from
Wheeler's 'Such is my bearing in this far land, where the barbarian foe
causes cruel arms to have more power than law' and Andr&eacute;'s 'Je vis au
loin, ici, o&ugrave; un ennemi barbare donne aux armes cruelles plus de force
qu'aux lois'. Merkel ejected the distich, which seems the best solution;
it is not necessary to the poem's structure, and the iterated <i>facit ut</i>
in unrelated clauses at 94 and 97 is suspicious. Also, as Professor R.
J. Tarrant notes, the <i>ut</i> in 94 makes one expect that <i>ut</i> in 95 will
be correlative, when it in fact continues the thought of 93 (or rather
of 91-92, after 93-94 are excised).</p>

<p>Heinsius thought 93 alone to be suspect; if so, the meaning lying behind
the text is probably something like 'What I once was at Rome, I still am
here'.</p>

<p><b>93-94. HIC, VBI BARBARVS HOSTIS, / VT FERA PLVS VALEANT LEGIBVS ARMA
FACIT.</b> Similar statements at <i>Tr</i> V vii 47-48 'non metuunt leges, sed
cedit uiribus aequum, / uictaque pugnaci iura sub ense iacent' and <i>Tr</i>
V x 43-44; see also Otto <i>lex</i> 3.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p><b>93. BARBARVS HOSTIS.</b> The same phrase at <i>Tr</i> III x 54, <i>Tr</i> IV i 82, and
<i>EP</i> II vii 70.</p>

<p><b>95. RE ... NVLLA</b> <i>MHIL</i> REM NVLLAM <i>BCFT</i>. The verb <i>queri</i> can take a
direct object, or be constructed with <i>de</i> + ablative, but not both;
this would in effect give the verb two objects. <i>Re ... nulla</i> removes
this difficulty and is obviously prone to corruption, the true object
<i>de nobis</i> being postponed to the following line.</p>

<p><b>96. FEMINA ... VIRVE PVERVE</b> = 'anyone'; compare <i>Tr</i> III vii 29-30 'pone,
Perilla, metum: tantummodo <i>femina nulla / neue uir</i> a scriptis discat
amare tuis', and Ovid's use of <i>femina uirque</i> 'everyone' at <i>Met</i> VI
314-15 '<i>femina uirque</i> timent cultuque impensius <i>omnes</i> ... uenerantur
numina', <i>RA</i> 814, <i>Tr</i> I iii 23, and <i>Tr</i> II 6. The repeated <i>u</i> in
<i>uirue</i> would not have offended the Romans: compare for instance <i>Tr</i>
III vii 30 'neue uir', <i>Am</i> I viii 97 'uiri uideat toto uestigia lecto',
and <i>Met</i> XII 204 'poteratque uiri uox illa uideri'; conscious
alliteration at <i>Am</i> III vii 59 'uiuosque uirosque' and <i>Met</i> XIII 386
'inuictumque uirum uicit'.</p>

<p><b>98. HAEC QVONIAM TELLVS TESTIFICANDA MIHI EST.</b> Similar phrasing at
<i>Ibis</i> 27-28 (of Augustus) 'faciet quoque forsitan idem / <i>terra</i> sit ut
propior <i>testificanda mihi</i>'.</p>

<p><b>100. RESPECTV ... SVI.</b> 'Out of consideration for themselves'. <i>Respectus</i>
elsewhere in Ovid only at <i>Tr</i> I iii 99-100 (of his wife after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> his
departure) '[narratur ...] uoluisse mali [<i>Madvig</i>: mori <i>codd</i>]
moriendo ponere sensus, / <i>respectu</i> tamen non periisse <i>mei</i>'.
<i>Respectus</i> is found in Phaedrus, Martial, and Juvenal, but not in
Virgil, Horace, or Propertius.</p>

<p><b>101. NEC MIHI CREDIDERIS</b> in its absolute use here seems colloquial:
elsewhere Ovid uses <i>nec ... credideris</i> to introduce a dependent clause
(<i>Tr</i> V xiv 43; <i>EP</i> I viii 29).</p>

<p><b>101. EXTANT DECRETA QVIBVS NOS / LAVDAT ET IMMVNES PVBLICA CERA FACIT.</b>
The same honour described in greater detail at xiv 51-56.</p>

<p><b>101. EXTANT</b> ('there exist') is somewhat more forceful than the nearly
equivalent <i>sunt</i>: compare xiv 44 '<i>extat</i> adhuc nemo saucius ore meo',
Cic <i>Planc</i> 2 'uideo ... hoc in numero neminem ... cuius non <i>extet</i> in me
summum meritum', and Cic <i>Diu</i> I 71.</p>

<p><b>102. PVBLICA CERA</b> = <i>tabulae publicae</i>, 'public records', for which
compare Cic <i>Arch</i> 8 &amp; <i>Fl</i> 40, and Livy XXVI 36 11. The same metonymy
at Val Max II x 1, where <i>tabulae</i> and <i>cera</i> are used as synonyms, and
at Hor <i>Ep</i> I vi 62 'Caerite cera', where commentators cite Aulus
Gellius' mention of <i>tabulae Caerites</i> (XVI 13).</p>

<p><b>103. QVAE</b> <i>R. J. Tarrant</i> HAEC <i>L, probante Heinsio</i> ET <i>BCMFHIT</i>.
<i>Quae</i> connects with <i>idem</i> in the following line and provides a more
satisfactory sense than <i>et</i>, which would make the sentence mean that
Ovid did not consider the decrees something to boast of. <i>Quae
quamquam</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> is preferable to <i>haec quamquam</i> since it connects better
with the preceding line and is obviously more prone to corruption; but
for a similar corruption of <i>haec</i> compare Prop II xxiii 1 'fuit indocti
haec [<i>uar</i> et] semita uulgi'. For <i>quae</i> Professor Tarrant cites <i>EP</i>
III v 9-10 '<i>quae quamquam</i> lingua mihi sunt properante per horas /
lecta satis multas, pauca fuisse queror' and <i>EP</i> III viii 23-24 '<i>quae
quamquam</i> misisse pudet ... tu tamen haec quaeso consule missa boni'.</p>

<p><b>103. QVAMQVAM ... SIT</b> <i>G</i> QVAMQVAM ... EST <i>BCMFHILT</i>. For the subjunctive
Luck compares <i>Met</i> XIV 465 'admonitu quamquam luctus renouentur amari'
and <i>Met</i> XV 244-45 '<i>quae</i> [<i>sc</i> elementa] <i>quamquam</i> spatio distent,
tamen omnia fiunt / ex ipsis'; in the first passage a few manuscripts
and in the second the majority offer the indicative. Ovid usually has
the indicative following <i>quamquam</i>; but <i>sit</i> should be taken as the
correct reading here in view of <i>G</i>'s early date.</p>

<p><b>105. NEC PIETAS IGNOTA MEA EST.</b> At xiii 19-38 Ovid describes an instance
of his <i>pietas</i>, the reciting to the Getes of a poem in Getic on
Tiberius.</p>

<p><b>105-10.</b> The figures of the imperial family had been a gift of Cotta
Maximus, for which <i>EP</i> II viii was a letter of thanks. For a discussion
of Ovid's treatment of the imperial family, particularly in the poems of
exile, see K. Scott "Emperor Worship in Ovid", <i>TAPA</i> LXI [1930] 43-69.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p><b>107. CONIVNXQVE SACERDOS.</b> Livia, priestess of the deified Augustus;
Germanicus was his <i>flamen</i>. For the language compare Vell Pat II 75 3
'Liuia ... genere, probitate, forma Romanarum eminentissima, quam postea
<i>coniugem</i> Augusti uidimus, quam transgressi ad deos <i>sacerdotem</i> ac

<p><b>111. PRECANTIA VERBA</b> = <i>preces</i>. The same phrase at <i>Met</i> VI 164, IX
159, and XIV 365.</p>

<p><b>112. EOO ... AB ORBE.</b> The same phrase at <i>Fast</i> III 466 &amp; V 557.</p>

<p><b>113-14.</b> Williams suggested deleting this distich: 'The distance between
<i>Tota</i> and <i>Pontica terra</i>, the use of <i>licet</i>=if, and <i>Pontica terra</i>
immediately followed by <i>Pontica tellus</i>, point to an interpolation'.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p><p>The hyperbaton of <i>tota ... Pontica terra</i> seems standard enough.
Wheeler translates <i>licet quaeras</i> as 'you are free to inquire', which
may be right; however, the phrase does indeed seem awkward, and <i>licet</i>
may be an intrusive gloss that has displaced <i>uelim</i>: compare <i>Her</i> IV
18 'fama&mdash;<i>uelim quaeras</i>&mdash;crimine nostra uacat'. The repetition of
<i>Pontica terra</i> and <i>Pontica ... tellus</i> is a very strong argument for
deleting one of the two distichs. However, 115-16 seems more likely to
be the interpolation in view of the difficulties discussed in the next
note.</p>

<p><b>115. ORA.</b> Ehwald (<i>KB</i> 65) read ARA (<i>B</i>), citing Dessau <i>ILS</i> 154 14-15
'ara(m) numini Augusto pecunia nostra faciendam curauimus; <i>ludos</i> / ex
idibus Augustis diebus sex p(ecunia) n(ostra) faciendos curauimus'; but
the <i>ara</i> and <i>ludi</i> are clearly separate items in the inscription,
which does not support the phrasing <i>ara natalem ludis celebrare</i>.</p>

<p>Even with <i>ora</i>, 115-16 read rather oddly: the notion of an individual
conducting <i>ludi</i> is strange, and the singular <i>dei</i> seems rather vague
after the collective <i>his</i> of 111. If the distich is excised (as
Professor R. J. Tarrant suggests) 113-14 round out the paragraph that
began with 105 (note the correspondence of <i>uidet hospita terra</i> in 105
with <i>testis Pontica terra</i> in 114), and 117 introduces <i>hospites</i> as a
second class of witnesses.</p>

<p><b>118. LONGA.</b> Not 'distant' (Wheeler) but 'long'; compare <i>Met</i> XIII 407
'longus in angustum qua clauditur Hellespontus'. <i>Longus</i> meaning
'distant' is extremely rare: <i>OLD longus</i> 6 cites only Silius VI 628<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
'remeans longis ... oris' and ps-Quintilian <i>Decl</i> 320 6 'longas terras
... peragraui' (Lewis and Short add Justinus 18 1 'longa a domo
militia'). The normal Latin words for 'distant' were <i>longinquus</i> and
<i>longe</i> (ancestor of French <i>loin</i>).</p>

<p><b>119. IS</b> in its various forms occurs only seven times in <i>EP</i> IV: the
other occurrences are of feminine singular <i>ea</i> at i 17, viii 27 &amp; xiv
11, of <i>eius</i> at xv 6 (its only occurrence in the <i>Ex Ponto</i>), of
accusative <i>id</i> at i 19, and of accusative neuter plural <i>ea</i> at x 35.</p>

<p>The elegiac poets avoided the use of <i>is</i>, preferring <i>hic</i>, <i>ille</i>, and
<i>iste</i>. The singular nominative forms were the only ones used relatively
freely by Ovid (about forty instances of each); Tibullus and Propertius
avoided even these (Platnauer 116; Axelson 70-71).</p>

brachylogy at <i>EP</i> I iv 31 'iunctior Haemonia est <i>Ponto</i> quam Roma
<i>sinistro</i> [<i>Burman</i>: sit Histro <i>codd</i>]'.</p>

<p><b>119. PRAESIDE.</b> This seems to be the first instance of <i>praeses</i>

<p><b>121. AVDIERIT.</b> Probably a perfect subjunctive 'may have heard', although
possibly an epistolary future perfect indicative ('when you receive
this, your brother will perhaps [<i>forsitan</i>] have heard'). For the
perfect subjunctive compare <i>Met</i> X 560-62 <i>'forsitan audieris</i> aliquam
certamine cursus / ueloces superasse uiros'.</p>

<p><b>121. FORTVNA.</b> 'My means' (Wheeler). The sense is rare but classical;

<p><b>126. ILLVM</b> <i>CMFHILTB<sup>2</sup></i> ILLI <i>B<sup>1</sup></i>. Either accusative or dative would be
acceptable enough with <i>latere</i>. The earliest instances from verse given
by <i>TLL</i> VII.2 997 49 are Lucretius III 280 for the dative and <i>Aen</i> I
130 for the accusative. I retain the accusative because it is the
reading of most manuscripts, including <i>B</i>'s close relative <i>C</i>. There
are similar variants involving the object of <i>latere</i> at <i>Fast</i> V 361:
the accusative given by most manuscripts is generally read in preference
to the dative.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p><b>129-30. INTER CONVEXA ... SIDERA</b> = <i>inter sidera conuexi caeli</i>; the
hypallage adds further to the elevation of the passage. For <i>conuexa</i>
compare Festus (58 Muller; 51 Lindsay) 'conuexum est ex omni parte
declinatum, <i>qualis est natura caeli</i>, quod ex omni parte ad terram
uersum declinatum est', <i>Met</i> I 26 'ignes <i>conuexi</i> uis et sine pondere
<i>caeli</i>', <i>Ecl</i> IV 50, and Cic <i>Arat</i> 560 (314). In particular compare
<i>Aen</i> I 607-8, which Ovid is clearly imitating: 'dum montibus umbrae /
lustrabunt, <i>conuexa</i> polus dum <i>sidera</i> pascet'. There is some question
as to whether <i>conuexa</i> should there be taken with <i>sidera</i>, or as the
object of <i>lustrabunt</i>: Ovid clearly took it with <i>sidera</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p><b>130. SOLLICITO QVAS DAMVS ORE PRECES.</b> For the general wording compare

<p><b>133-34. NEC TV / IMMERITO NOMEN MITE PARENTIS HABES.</b> 'Et ce n'est pas
sans raison que tu portes le doux nom de P&egrave;re' (Andr&eacute;) must be correct
as against Wheeler's 'for not undeservedly hast thou the gracious name
of "Father"', since <i>nec</i>, although it can mean <i>et ... non</i> or <i>sed
... non</i>, cannot mean <i>nam ... non</i>; the proof of this is the frequent
occurrence of <i>neque enim</i>.</p>

<p>The litotes <i>non (haud, nec) immerito</i> is common enough in Latin: see
the many examples at <i>TLL</i> VII.1 457 26 ff. But in the four
instances given of <i>nec immerito</i>, it never serves to introduce a new
phrase as here. At Plautus <i>St</i> 28 'decet <i>neque</i> id <i>immerito</i> eueniet'
it introduces a second verb which amplifies the preceding one, while it
modifies preceding verbs at Ter <i>Ad</i> 615 'tanta nunc suspicio de me
incidit <i>neque</i> ea immerito', Val Max IV vii 1 'inimicus patriae fuisse
Ti. Gracchus existimatus est, <i>nec immerito</i>, quia potentiam suam
saluti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> eius praetulerat', and Quintilian X i 104 'habet amatores&mdash;<i>nec
immerito</i>&mdash;Cremuti libertas'. One would expect a clause of causation to
follow <i>auguror his igitur flecti tua numina</i>, and I think it possible
that Ovid wrote NAM TV / E MERITO (Professor C. P. Jones suggests EX
MERITO). Both the corruption from <i>e merito</i> and the subsequent
interpolation of <i>nec</i> would be easy enough. For <i>e(x) merito</i>, compare
vii 16 'contigit <i>ex merito</i> qui tibi nuper honor'.</p>

<p><b>133. NEC TV.</b> The elegiac poets admitted a monosyllabic ending to the
hexameter if it was preceded by another monosyllable closely linked to
it in sense: see Platnauer 13. For true monosyllabic endings, see at ii
47 <i>Aonius fons</i>.</p>

<p><b>134. NOMEN MITE PARENTIS</b> = <i>nomen parentis, quod significat te mitem
esse</i>. At <i>Tr</i> I i 73 and <i>EP</i> II viii 51 members of the imperial family
are called <i>mitissima numina</i>. There is another instance of hypallage
with <i>nomen mite</i> (a different sense of <i>mitis</i> being used) at <i>Fast</i> V
64 '<i>nomen</i> et aetatis <i>mite</i> [<i>codd</i>: rite <i>Riese</i>] senatus erat', 'the
very name of senate signified a ripe old age' (Frazer).</p>

<p><b>134. PARENTIS</b> = <i>patris patriae</i>. For the title compare <i>Res Gestae</i> 35
(the final achievement listed by Augustus) 'tertium decimum consulatum
cum gerebam, senatus et equester ordo populusque Romanus uniuersus

<h2><a name="X_To_Albinovanus_Pedo" id="X_To_Albinovanus_Pedo"></a>X. To Albinovanus Pedo</h2>


<p>The poem is the only one in the <i>Ex Ponto</i> addressed to Albinovanus.
Considering the elder Seneca's express testimony that Albinovanus was a
close friend of Ovid (see at 4 [pp 327-28]), this is rather surprising;
perhaps Albinovanus, an associate of Germanicus (Tac <i>Ann</i> I 60 2), had,
like some of Ovid's other friends, asked not to be mentioned in his
verse.</p>

<p>The poem begins with the statement that Ovid is now in his sixth year of
exile; unlike flint and iron, he is not touched by the passing of time
(1-8). He says that his tribulations are like those of Ulysses, but more
severe; there follows a comparison of his experiences with those of
Ulysses (9-30). He then describes the bleakness of the climate, and how
the sea freezes over in winter (31-34). He has heard that his accounts
are not believed at Rome, and will therefore explain the reasons for the
sea's freezing over (35-38). At Tomis the north wind prevails, and the
salinity of the sea is reduced by the influx of many large rivers (which
are listed in a catalogue); the sea's freezing is caused by these two
factors (39-64). He is telling all this to Albinovanus to pass the time;
Albinovanus is writing poetry as well, about Theseus, who is an example
for him to follow (65-82). Ovid does not wish to imply that Albinovanus
is not already doing everything possible to assist him (83-84).</p>

<p>The poem combines with remarkable ease a number of quite disparate
subjects, and is in this sense reminiscent of Tibullus. Most of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
subjects had been used previously in the poetry of exile; in particular,
see <i>Tr</i> I v 57-84 for an extended comparison of the trials of Ulysses
and those of Ovid. The disquisition on the reasons for the Euxine's
freezing over is, however, new. It seems to have been drawn from a
geographical or physical treatise which has left its mark elsewhere in
Latin literature: see at 37-38 (<a href="#Page_340">p 340-42</a>).</p>

<p><b>1. CIMMERIO</b> <i>British Library Harley 2607 (Tarrant)</i> CVMERIO <i>M<sup>1</sup></i> IN

<span class="u">EXINO</span> <i>B<sup>2c</sup></i> BISTONIO <i>LM<sup>2ul</sup></i> Many centuries had passed since the
Cimmerians had inhabited Scythia; even Herodotus, who tells the story of
their departure, seems to regard the event as belonging to the distant
past (IV 11-12). Homer was vaguely aware of the nation: at <i>Od</i> XI 13-19
(imitated at <i>Pan Mess</i> 64-66), he speaks of the '&#922;&#953;&#956;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#943;&#969;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#8182;&#957; ... &#960;&#972;&#955;&#953;&#962;'
by the stream of Ocean, which never receives sunlight.</p>

<p>For <i>Cimmerio</i> Burman compared Claudian <i>Cons Stil</i> I 129 'nunc prope
Cimmerii tendebat litora <i>Ponti</i>'; see as well <i>In Eutr</i> I 249 'extra
<i>Cimmerias</i>, Taurorum claustra, paludes'.</p>

<p><b>1. BIS TERTIA ... AESTAS.</b> The poem is therefore dated to the summer of
14. For Ovid's mentions of the length of his exile, see at vi 5

<p><b>4. ALBINOVANE.</b> Albinovanus Pedo<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and Ovid seem to have been close
friends. Ovid mentions him again at xvi 6 'sidereusque Pedo', and he was
the source of the famous anecdote in the elder Seneca (<i>Cont</i> II 2 12)
of how Ovid chose as the three lines in his poems he most wished to
retain the same three verses a group of his friends most wished to
remove.</p>

<p>He was a famous raconteur: the younger Seneca calls Pedo <i>fabulator
elegantissimus</i> at <i>Ep</i> CXXII 15-16 when repeating one of his anecdotes.</p>

<p>At the time this poem was written, Albinovanus was engaged on a
<i>Theseid</i> (71). Quintilian perhaps had this poem in mind when he
included a rather slighting mention of Albinovanus in his catalogue of
epic poets at X i 90: 'Rabirius ac Pedo non indigni cognitione, si
uacet'. He may, however, have been thinking of Albinovanus' poem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span> on
Germanicus' campaigns, of which the elder Seneca preserves some
twenty-three hexameters (<i>Suas</i> I 15; commentary by V. Bongi, <i>Istituto
Lombardo di scienze e lett. Rendiconti [Classe di Lettere]</i> ser. 3 13
[1949], 28-48. Norden and others have attributed Morel <i>Incert</i> 46
'ingenia immansueta suoque simillima caelo' to the same poem). Martial
several times mentions Albinovanus as a writer of epigrams (II lxxvii 5,
V v 5 &amp; X xx (xix) 10); this fits well with the younger Seneca's
description of Albinovanus as <i>fabulator elegantissimus</i>.</p>

<p>At <i>Ann</i> I 60 2, Tacitus mentions Pedo as 'praefectus finibus Frisiorum'
in Germanicus' campaign of 15.</p>

consumitur <i>anulus</i> usu, / interit assidua <i>uomer</i> aduncus humo. / quid
magis est saxo durum, quid mollius unda? / dura tamen molli saxa
cauantur aqua'.</p>

<p><b>6. ATTERITVR</b> <i>Heinsius</i>. Korn and Riese printed the manuscripts' ET
TERITVR, for which Riese cited <i>Tr</i> I iv 9-10 'pinea texta sonant pulsu
[<i>Rothmaler</i>: pulsi <i>codd</i>], stridore rudentes, / ingemit <i>et</i> nostris
ipsa carina malis' and <i>Tr</i> III iv 57-58 'ante oculos errant domus,
urbsque et forma locorum, / accedunt<i>que</i> suis singula facta locis', but
these are extended descriptions of single events, not lists of separate
examples.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>Elsewhere in Ovid, the only form found of <i>atterere</i> is <i>attritus</i>: this
circumstance perhaps contributed to the corruption of the present
passage.</p>

<p><b>6. ATTERITVR PRESSA VOMER ADVNCVS HVMO.</b> Professor R. J. Tarrant points
out to me the hypallage in this passage. <i>Pressus</i> is to be taken twice,
with <i>uomer</i> and with <i>humo</i>: the earth is <i>pressed down</i> as the plough
is <i>pressed</i> into it.</p>

<p><b>7. TEMPVS EDAX.</b> The same phrase at <i>Met</i> XV 234; compare as well <i>edax

<p><b>7. PRAETER NOS.</b> At <i>EP</i> II vii 39-45, Ovid (with a series of images
parallel to that of the present passage) says that he is in fact being
worn away by the hardships he is enduring: 'ut ... caducis / percussu
crebro <i>saxa</i> cauantur aquis, / sic ego continuo Fortunae uulneror ictu
... nec magis assiduo <i>uomer</i> tenuatur ab usu, / nec magis est curuis
Appia trita rotis, / pectora quam mea sunt serie calcata malorum'.</p>

<p><b>8. PERDIT</b> <i>I</i> PERDET <i>BCMFHLT</i>. The tense is made probable by the
preceding <i>cauat ... consumitur ... atteritur</i> and the following <i>cessat</i>;
compare as well <i>Tr</i> IV vi 17-18 'cuncta pot<i>est</i> ... uetustas / praeter
quam curas attenuare meas'. Third conjugation verbs in the third person
are for obvious reasons peculiarly apt to corruption of tense and mood.
The alteration from present to future is rather less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> common than the
inverse corruption, for an instance of which see at xii 18 <i>reddet</i>
(<a href="#Page_378">p 378</a>).</p>

<p><b>8. CESSAT DVRITIA MORS QVOQVE VICTA MEA.</b> Death does not conquer Ovid,
but is conquered by him. Professor E. Fantham points out to me the
baroque inversion in the phrase, citing as a parallel Sen <i>Tr</i> 1171-75,
where Hecuba says that death fears her and flees her.</p>

<p>Riese placed a question mark at the end of the line, but since in 7 Ovid
asserts unambiguously that time does not affect him, there seems no
reason to make the following line a question. In his poems from exile
Ovid often expresses his wish to die; see <i>Tr</i> III viii 39-40 'tantus
amor necis est querar ut cum Caesaris ira / quod non offensas uindicet
ense suas', <i>Tr</i> III xiii 5-6, IV vi 49-50, and V ix 37-38.</p>

<p><b>9. EXEMPLVM EST ANIMI NIMIVM PATIENTIS VLIXES.</b> Ovid frequently compares
his trials in exile to those undergone by Ulysses. The longest instance
of this is <i>Tr</i> I v 57-84; compare as well <i>Tr</i> III xi 61-62 'crede
mihi, si sit nobis collatus Vlixes, / Neptuni minor est quam Iouis ira
fuit', <i>Tr</i> V v 1-4, and <i>EP</i> I iii 33-34, II vii 59-60 &amp; III vi 19-20.</p>

<p>Ulysses' voyage was a favourite subject of the Latin poets. For a
surviving example, see Prop III xii 23-36. An indication of the
subject's popularity is the fact that <i>Pan Mess</i> 45-49 'nam seu diuersi
fremat inconstantia uulgi, / non alius sedare queat; seu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span> iudicis ira /
sit placanda, tuis poterit mitescere uerbis. / non Pylos aut Ithace
tantos genuisse feruntur / Nestora uel paruae magnum decus urbis Vlixem'
is followed not by a description of Ulysses' eloquence, as would have
been appropriate, but by a narrative of his travels (52-81): this
illogical sequence was no doubt induced by the poet's familiarity with
similar descriptions of Ulysses' voyage in the poetry of his time.</p>

<p>Professor E. Fantham cites Seneca's use of Ulysses as an <i>exemplum
patientiae</i> at Sen <i>Dial</i> II 2 1, where Hercules is compared to Ulysses.</p>

<p><b>9. EXEMPLVM EST.</b> Professor R. J. Tarrant points out to me the unusual
baldness of the phrase. In Ovid's earlier verse <i>exemplum</i> has an
instructional or minatory overtone (<i>AA</i> III 686, <i>Met</i> IX 454). The
flatter use of <i>exemplum</i> seems to be typical of the poetry of exile:
compare <i>EP</i> III i 44 'coniugis exemplum diceris esse bonae', and <i>Tr</i> I
v 21, IV iii 72 &amp; IV iv 71.</p>

<p><b>9. NIMIVM PATIENTIS</b> = &#960;&#959;&#955;&#973;&#964;&#955;&#945;&#962; (<i>Il</i> VIII 97, <i>Od</i> V 171, et
saep.). The sense of <i>nimium</i> seen here is not generally found in
poetry, or even in literary prose; the instances cited by <i>OLD nimium<sup>2</sup></i>
2 are all from comedy, Cato, and the letters of Cicero.</p>

<p><b>10. DVO LVSTRA.</b> Compare xvi 13-14 'Vlixem / errantem saeuo per <i>duo
lustra</i> mari' and <i>AA</i> III 15-16 'est pia Penelope <i>lustris</i> errante
<i>duobus</i> / et totidem lustris bella gerente uiro'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p><b>11. SOLLICITI ... FATI</b> is based on such phrases as <i>sollicita uita</i> (Prop
II vii 1) and <i>sollicitissima aetas</i> (Sen <i>Breu Vit</i> 16 1). Similar
phrasing at <i>Tr</i> IV x 116 'nec me <i>sollicitae</i> taedia <i>lucis</i> habent'.</p>

<p><b>11. PLACIDAE SAEPE FVERE MORAE.</b> Compare Prop III xii 23-24 'Postumus
alter erit miranda coniuge Vlixes: / non illi <i>longae</i> tot nocuere
<i>morae</i>'.</p>

<p><b>13. SEX ANNIS.</b> According to Homer (<i>Od</i> VII 261), Ulysses left Calypso
in the eighth year of his stay on her island. Andr&eacute; points out that
Hyginus <i>Fab</i> CXXV 16 has Ulysses on the island for one year only; for
other estimates of the length of Ulysses' stay, see Roscher III 627.
Ovid was probably influenced by the <i>bis ... tertia</i> of the poem's
opening. <i>Cimmerio</i> in 1 furnishes another connection with Ulysses (<i>Od</i>
XI 14; quoted at 1).</p>

<p><b>13. FOVISSE.</b> Compare <i>Od</i> V 118-120 (Calypso speaking) '&#931;&#967;&#941;&#964;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#949;,

<p><b>13. CALYPSO</b> <i>BCMILT</i>. Lenz and Andr&eacute; print CALYPSON (<i>FH</i>). Roman poets
followed the Greek declension of feminine proper nouns ending in
-&#969;; compare <i>Pan Mess</i> 77 'fecunda Atlantidos arua <i>Calypsus</i>
[<i>uar</i> calipsos]'. The accusatives of such nouns are of the same form as
the nominative. See for example <i>Aen</i> IV 383-84 'et nomine <i>Dido</i> /
saepe uocaturum' and <i>Aen</i> VII 324-25 'luctificam <i>Allecto</i> dirarum ab
sede dearum /<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span> infernisque ciet tenebris', cited by Charisius 63 (Keil);
neither he nor Servius shows knowledge of an accusative in <i>-on</i>.
Scribes, however, found the declension puzzling; and it is common to
find the pseudo-accusative in <i>-on</i> offered by some manuscripts whenever
the true form in <i>-o</i> occurs; this has happened at <i>Her</i> VI 65 'ultimus
e sociis sacram conscendis in <i>Argo</i>', <i>Her</i> VII 7 'certus es ire tamen
miseramque relinquere <i>Dido</i> [<i>edd</i>: Didon <i>codd</i>]', <i>Her</i> XII 9 'cur
umquam Colchi Magnetida uidimus <i>Argo</i>', <i>Am</i> II ii 45 'dum nimium
seruat custos Iunonius <i>Io</i>', <i>Am</i> II xix 29 'dum seruat Iuno mutatam
cornibus <i>Io</i>', and Prop I xx 17-18 'namque ferunt olim Pagasae
naualibus <i>Argo</i> [<i>edd</i>: Argon <i>codd</i>] / egressam longe Phasidos isse
uiam'. Modern editors often print the spurious form, even at <i>AA</i> I 323
'et modo se Europen fieri, modo postulat <i>Io</i>', where all manuscripts
offer the correct reading.</p>

<p>For a full discussion of this and the inverse corruption (for instance
of <i>Iason</i> to <i>Iaso</i>), see Goold 12-14.</p>

<p><b>14. AEQVOREAEQVE.</b> Compare <i>Am</i> II xvii 17-18 'creditur <i>aequoream</i> Pthio
Nereida regi, / Egeriam iusto concubuisse Numae' and <i>AA</i> II 123-24 'non
formosus erat, sed erat facundus Vlixes, / et tamen <i>aequoreas</i> torsit
amore deas'. Merkel's AEAEAEQVE is ingenious but unnecessary.</p>

<p><b>15. HIPPOTADES</b> = <i>Aeolus</i>. The same patronymic at <i>Met</i> IV 663, XI 431,
XIV 86, XIV 224 &amp; XV 707.</p>

<p><b>15. QVI DAT PRO MVNERE VENTOS.</b> Compare <i>Met</i> XIV 223-26 'Aeolon ille

<p><b>17. NEC BENE CANTANTES LABOR EST AVDISSE PVELLAS.</b> The description is
intentionally prosaic. For the Homeric account of the Sirens see <i>Od</i>
XII 37-54 &amp; 153-200.</p>

<p><b>17. AVDISSE</b> <i>F</i> AVDIRE <i>BCMHILT</i>. <i>Audire</i> cannot stand, as the present
tense conflicts with <i>fuit</i> in the following line. For <i>est audisse</i>
representing <i>fuit audire</i>, compare <i>Met</i> IX 5-6 (Achelous hesitates
before recounting his wrestling-match with Hercules) 'referam tamen
ordine: nec tam / turpe <i>fuit uinci</i> quam <i>contendisse decorum est</i>'.</p>

<p><b>18. NEC DEGVSTANTI LOTOS AMARA FVIT.</b> See <i>Od</i> IX 82-104 for Homer's
account of the Lotus-eaters.</p>

<p><b>18. NEC ... AMARA</b> = <i>et dulcis</i>. Compare <i>Od</i> IX 94 '&#955;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#959; ... &#956;&#949;&#955;&#953;&#951;&#948;&#941;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#961;&#960;&#972;&#957;'.</p>

<p><b>18. DEGVSTANTI.</b> The verb is extremely rare in the sense 'taste, sample';
this is the only instance of the meaning found in poetry, although a
transferred use is found at Lucretius II 191-92 'ignes ... celeri flamma
<i>degustant</i> tigna trabesque' and <i>Aen</i> XII 375-76 'lancea ... summum
<i>degustat</i> uulnere corpus'.</p>

<p>Ovid uses the somewhat more common <i>gustare</i> in a similar context at

nocuit grata sapore fuit'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p><b>21. VRBEM LAESTRYGONOS</b> = '&#923;&#940;&#956;&#959;&#965; &#945;&#7984;&#960;&#8058; &#960;&#964;&#959;&#955;&#943;&#949;&#952;&#961;&#959;&#957;, / &#932;&#951;&#955;&#941;&#960;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#923;&#945;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#965;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#943;&#951;&#957;'
(<i>Od</i> X 81-82) or 'Lami ueterem Laestrygonos ... urbem'
(<i>Met</i> XIV 233), where the crews of all the ships but Ulysses' own were
killed and eaten; accounts of this at <i>Od</i> X 76-132 and <i>Met</i> XIV
233-42. Ovid refers again to the episode at <i>EP</i> II ix 41 'quis non
Antiphaten Laestrygona deuouet?'.</p>

<p><b>21. LAESTRYGONOS</b> <i>BC</i> LE(-I-)STRYGONIS <i>MFHILT</i>. <i>Laestrygonos</i> =
&#923;&#945;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#965;&#947;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#962; (<i>Od</i> X 106). At <i>Met</i> XIV 233 (cited above) all
manuscripts offer <i>Laestrygonis</i>; the Greek genitive should probably be
read as here.</p>

<p><b>22. GENTIBVS OBLIQVA QVAS OBIT HISTER AQVA.</b> Similar wording at ii 37-38
'hic mea cui recitem nisi flauis scripta Corallis, / quasque alias
gentes barbarus Hister obit?'.</p>

<p><b>22. OBLIQVA</b> apparently refers to the swirling of a river's eddies. The
sense 'winding' generally given the word would fit at <i>Met</i> IX 17-18
(Achelous to the father of Deianira) 'dominum me cernis aquarum /
cursibus <i>obliquis</i> inter tua regna fluentum', but not at <i>Met</i> VIII
550-53 (Achelous to Theseus) '"succede meis" ait "Inclite, tectis, /
Cecropide, nec te committe rapacibus undis: / ferre trabes solidas
<i>obliquaque</i> uoluere magno / murmure saxa solent"' or <i>Her</i> VI 87 'illa
refrenat aquas <i>obliquaque</i> flumina sistit'. At <i>Met</i> I 39 'fluminaque
<i>obliquis</i> cinxit decliuia ripis', <i>obliquis</i> should be taken with
<i>flumina</i>, and <i>decliuia</i> with <i>ripis</i>; or possibly both adjectives
should be taken with both nouns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p><b>23. VINCET.</b> Like <i>superare</i>, <i>uincere</i> has the twin meanings of
'surpass' and 'defeat'.</p>

<p><b>23. CYCLOPS.</b> The same pairing of the Laestrygonians and Polyphemus at
<i>EP</i> II ii 113-114 (to Messalinus; he should address Augustus on Ovid's
behalf) 'nec tamen Aetnaeus uasto Polyphemus in antro / accipiet uoces
Antiphatesue tuas'.</p>

<p><b>23. FERITATE</b> goes with <i>uincet</i>: 'will surpass in savagery'. I once
thought PIETATE (<i>BCI<sup>ac</sup></i>) was the correct reading, connecting the word
with <i>saeuum</i> and taking it as a reference to human sacrifice; but this
seems strained and obscure. <i>Pietate</i> may be an intrusion from
ecclesiastical Latin; Professor R. J. Tarrant suggests that it is
possibly an anticipation of the following <i>Piacchen</i>.</p>

<p><b>23. PIACCHEN</b> <i>B</i> PIAECHEN <i>C</i>. See the critical apparatus for the other
forms offered by the manuscripts. As the king's name is not elsewhere
recorded, its true form must remain in doubt.</p>

<p><b>24. QVI QVOTA TERRORIS PARS SOLET ESSE MEI.</b> With Burman, Weber, and
Wheeler I take the line as a statement: compare <i>EP</i> II x 31 'et <i>quota
pars</i> haec sunt rerum quas uidimus ambo' (cited by Williams), where
<i>quota</i>, as here, takes the meaning 'how small' from context. Most
editors take it as a question, for which compare <i>Am</i> II xii 9-10
'Pergama cum caderent bello superata bilustri, / ex tot in Atridis <i>pars
quota</i> laudis erat?'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p><b>25-27. SCYLLA ... CHARYBDIN.</b> Ovid gives similar descriptions of Scylla at
<i>Am</i> III xii 21-22 and <i>EP</i> III i 122, of Charybdis at <i>Am</i> II xvi
25-26, and of Scylla and Charybdis at <i>Her</i> XII 123-26 and <i>Met</i> XIII
730-33. All such descriptions in Latin poetry of course derive
ultimately from <i>Od</i> XII 73-110.</p>

<p><b>25. QVOD LATRET AB INGVINE MONSTRIS.</b> Professor R. J. Tarrant points out
to me Ovid's imitation here of <i>Ecl</i> VI 74-75 'Scyllam ... candida
succinctam latrantibus inguina monstris'; the <i>rates</i> and <i>nautae</i> of
Ovid's line 26 are in lines 76 and 77 of the Virgilian passage.</p>

<p><b>25. QVOD.</b> 'Granted that'. B&ouml;mer at <i>Met</i> VII 705 claims that the only
passage where this is the necessary meaning of <i>quod</i> is <i>Priapea</i> VI 1
'quod sum ligneus ... Priapus ... prendam te tamen', but it seems to be
the meaning required at Lucretius II 532-35 'nam <i>quod</i> rara uides magis
esse animalia quaedam / fecundamque minus naturam cernis in illis, / at
regione locoque alio terrisque remotis / multa licet genere esse in eo
numerumque repleri'.</p>

<p>All six instances of the idiom cited by the <i>OLD</i> (<i>quod</i> 6c) are from
poetry. In the two instances already cited, <i>quod</i> is followed by the
indicative, as is the case at Prop III ii 11-16. <i>Quod</i> in this sense
followed by the subjunctive seems to be an Ovidian idiom; it is used by
him at <i>Her</i> IV 157-61 '<i>quod</i> mihi <i>sit</i> genitor, qui possidet aequora,
Minos, / quod <i>ueniant</i> proaui fulmina torta manu, / quod <i>sit</i> auus
radiis frontem uallatus acutis, / purpureo tepidum qui mouet axe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
diem&mdash; / nobilitas sub amore iacet!' and <i>Met</i> VII 704-7 'liceat mihi
uera referre / pace deae: quod <i>sit</i> roseo spectabilis ore, / quod
<i>teneat</i> lucis, <i>teneat</i> confinia noctis, / nectareis quod <i>alatur</i>
aquis, ego Procrin amabam', and by an imitator of Ovid at <i>Her</i> XVIII
41.</p>

<p><b>26. HENIOCHAE NAVTIS PLVS NOCVERE RATES.</b> The Heniochi lived on the
eastern shore of the Euxine and were, as Ovid indicates, known as
pirates (Strabo XI 2 12-13).</p>

<p><b>27. INFESTIS ... ACHAEIS.</b> Mela includes the Achaei and the Heniochi in
his list of 'ferae incultaeque gentes uasto mari adsidentes' (I 110).
The two nations are grouped together by Strabo (XII 2 12) and Pliny
(<i>NH</i> VI 30).</p>

<p><b>28. EPOTVM ... VOMAT.</b> Professor R. J. Tarrant cites the verbal similarity
at (pseudo-Ovidian) <i>Am</i> III v 18 'iterum <i>pasto pascitur</i> ante cibo'.</p>

<p><b>28. EPOTVM</b> <i>B</i> ET POTVM <i>C</i> EPOTET <i>MFHILT</i>. <i>Epotet</i> is supported by
<i>Her</i> XII 125 'quaeque uomit totidem fluctus totidemque resorbet' and Od
XII 105-6 '&#964;&#961;&#8054;&#962; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#947;&#940;&#961; &#964;' &#7936;&#957;&#943;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7952;&#960;' &#7972;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;, &#964;&#961;&#8054;&#962; &#948;' &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#946;&#948;&#949;&#8150; /  &#948;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#957;'.
Professor A. Dalzell points out in particular '&#964;&#961;&#8054;&#962; ... &#964;&#961;&#8054;&#962;' paralleling <i>ter ... ter</i> in the present passage.
But at <i>RA</i>
740 Ovid wrote 'hic uomit epotas [<i>uarr</i> et potat; hic potat; optatas;
acceptas; aequoreas] dira Charybdis aquas'; and the corruption to
<i>epotet</i> seems much more probable than the inverse. Ovid elsewhere uses
only the perfect participle of <i>epotare</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p><b>29. LICENTIVS ERRANT.</b> Ovid is clearly imitating <i>Aen</i> VII 557-58 (Juno
to Allecto) 'te super aetherias <i>errare licentius</i> auras / haud pater
ille uelit, summi regnator Olympi', apparently the only other instance
of <i>licentius</i> in classical verse.</p>

<p><b>31-32</b> act as a bridge to the next major section of the poem, and do not
in themselves contribute to what has been said.</p>

<p><b>31. INFRONDES</b> is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>.</p>

<p><b>32. HIC FRETA VEL PEDITI PERVIA REDDIT HIEMPS.</b> Other mentions of the
sea's freezing at vii 7, <i>Tr</i> II 196, III x 35-50 &amp; V x 2, and <i>EP</i> III
i 15-16 (to the Pontus) 'tu glacie freta uincta tenes, et in aequore
piscis / inclusus tecta saepe natauit aqua'.</p>

<p>Parts of the Black Sea do in fact freeze: 'In winter, spurs of the
Siberian anticyclone (clear, dry, high-pressure air mass) create a
strong current of cold air, and the northwestern Black Sea cools down
considerably, with regular ice formation' (article on "Black Sea",
<i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, Macropaedia vol. 2, pp. 1096-98 [Chicago:
1974]).</p>

<p><b>32. HIEMPS.</b> For the last one hundred years, the spelling given in
editions of Latin texts has generally been <i>hiems</i> (some exceptions are
Palmer's <i>Heroides</i>, the Paravia Virgil, and Reynolds' editions of
Seneca), but the spelling in the ancient manuscripts of Virgil is
invariably <i>hiemps</i>. Munro's argument for this spelling seems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
unanswerable: 'obeying the almost unanimous testimony of our own [i.e.
<i>O</i> and <i>Q</i> of Lucretius] and other good mss. we cannot but give
<i>umerus</i> <i>umor</i> and the like: also <i>hiemps</i>. I have heard it asked what
then is the genitive of <i>hiemps</i>; to which the best reply perhaps would
be what is the perfect of <i>sumo</i> or the supine of <i>emo</i>. The Latins
wrote <i>hiemps</i>, as they wrote <i>emptum</i> <i>sumpsi</i> <i>sumptum</i> and a hundred
such forms, because they disliked <i>m</i> and <i>s</i> or <i>t</i> to come together
without the intervention of a <i>p</i> sound; and our mss. all attest this:
<i>tempto</i> likewise is the only true form, which the Italians in the 15th
century rejected for <i>tento</i>' (Lucretius ed. 4 vol. 1 p. 33).</p>

<p><b>33-34. VT, QVA REMVS ITER PVLSIS MODO FECERAT VNDIS, / SICCVS CONTEMPTA
NAVE VIATOR EAT.</b> Ovid has in mind Virgil's description of the freezing
of a Scythian river (<i>G</i> III 360-62) 'concrescunt subitae currenti in
flumine crustae, / undaque iam tergo ferratos sustinet orbis, / puppibus
illa prius, patulis nunc hospita plaustris'.</p>

<p><b>35. QVI VENIVNT ISTINC VIX VOS EA CREDERE DICVNT; / QVAM MISER EST QVI
FERT ASPERIORA FIDE.</b> For Ovid's fear that his accounts of what he has
undergone will not be believed, see vii 3-4 and <i>Tr</i> I v 49-50, III x
35-36 &amp; IV i 65-66. In particular, see ix 85-86 'mentiar, an coeat
duratus frigore Pontus, / et teneat glacies iugera multa freti'.</p>

<p><b>37-38. NEC TE CAVSAS NESCIRE SINEMVS / HORRIDA SARMATICVM CVR MARE DVRET
HIEMPS.</b> Ovid's principal explanation of the freezing of the Euxine, the
low salinity of the water, is found in four other Latin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span> authors. At IV
718-28, Valerius Flaccus offers a catalogue of rivers similar to that of
Ovid, and, like Ovid, gives the cold winter winds as a subsidiary reason
for the freezing. It is quite possible that Ovid is Valerius' source;
but this is very unlikely to be the case for Macrobius <i>Sat</i> VII xii
28-38 (cited by Burman). The passage is a discussion of why, although
oil congeals, wine and vinegar do not. Wine does not freeze because it
contains elements of fire; this is why Homer called it &#945;&#7988;&#952;&#959;&#960;&#945; &#959;&#7990;&#957;&#959;&#957;.
Vinegar does not freeze because it is so bitter; it is like
seawater, which because of its bitterness does not congeal. 'nam quod
Herodotus historiarum scriptor contra omnium ferme qui haec quaesiuerunt
opinionem scripsit [IV 28], mare Bosporicum, quod et Cimmerium appellat,
earumque partium mare omne, quod Scythicum dicitur, id gelu constringi
et consistere, aliter est quam putatur'. It is not the seawater that
freezes, but the layer of fresh water above it, which comes from the
rivers that flow into the Euxine. Macrobius goes on to explain that
there is an outflow of fresh water to the Mediterranean and an influx of
seawater, with perfect correctness: the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>
article cited at 32 notes that 'Flows in the Bosporus are complex, with
surface Black Sea water going out and deep, saltier water coming in from
the Sea of Marmara*.</p>

<p>There can be very little doubt, given the identity of the explanations
and the similarity of language, that Ovid and Macrobius were drawing on
a common source. The same source is reflected at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span> Gellius XVII viii
8-16. Here Taurus the philosopher asks Gellius why oil often congeals,
but wine does not. Gellius answers that wine is fiery by nature, which
is why Homer called it &#945;&#7988;&#952;&#959;&#960;&#945; &#959;&#7990;&#957;&#959;&#957;. Taurus responds that wine
is indeed known to have fire in it, for it warms the body when drunk;
yet vinegar, in spite of its cooling effects, never freezes; perhaps
things which are light and smooth are more prone to freezing. It is also
worth asking why fresh water freezes, but seawater does not. 'tametsi
Herodotus ... historiae scriptor contra omnium ferme qui haec
quaesiuerunt opinionem scribit mare Bosporicum, quod Cimmerium
appellatur, earumque partium mare omne quod Scythicum dicitur, gelu

given.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Ammianus Marcellinus XXII 8 48 gives the same two explanations for the
Euxine's freezing as Ovid: 'quicquid autem eiusdem Pontici sinus
Aquilone caeditur et pruinis, ita perstringitur gelu ut nec amnium
cursus subteruolui credantur, nec per infidum et labile solum gressus
hominis possit uel iumenti firmari, quod uitium numquam mare sincerum,
sed permixtum aquis amnicis temptat'. At XXII 8 46 he once again
mentions the sweetness of the Euxine's waters.</p>

<p>Lucan describes the freezing of the Euxine (V 436-41), but gives no
explanation of the cause.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Praebentia formam</i> is elevated diction: Professor R. J. Tarrant cites

<i>praebet</i>'.</p>

<p><b>40. PERPETVVM</b> <i>M<sup>2ul</sup></i> PRAECIPVVM <i>BCM<sup>1</sup>FHILT</i>. <i>Praecipuum</i> could be
defended by <i>EP</i> III i 13-14 (to the Pontus) 'nec tibi pampineas
autumnus porrigit uuas, / cuncta sed immodicum tempora frigus habet',
but <i>praecipuus</i> in fact always seems to have the notion of
'outstanding' or 'superior', which does not seem appropriate to the
present passage. For <i>perpetuum</i> compare <i>Tr</i> III ii 7-8 'plurima sed
pelago terraque pericula passum /<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span> ustus ab <i>assiduo</i> frigore Pontus

extremi iaceo desertus harenis, / fert ubi <i>perpetuas</i> obruta terra
niues', and <i>EP</i> II vii 72 'frigore <i>perpetuo</i> Sarmatis ora riget'.</p>

<p><b>41. HINC ORITVR BOREAS.</b> Compare <i>Tr</i> III xi 7-8 'barbara me tellus et
inhospita litora Ponti / cumque suo <i>Borea</i> Maenalis ursa uidet' and
<i>Ibis</i> 11-12 'ille relegatum gelidos <i>Aquilonis ad ortus</i> / non sinit
exilio delituisse meo'.</p>

<p><b>41. DOMESTICVS.</b> The word is rare in verse; Ovid uses it as a substantive
at iii 15 'ille ego conuictor densoque <i>domesticus</i> usu'. Here Ovid may
be recalling the language of <i>Met</i> VI 685-86 (of Boreas) 'ira, / quae
solita est illi nimiumque <i>domestica</i> uento'.</p>

<p><b>42. VIRES.</b> Merkel proposed MORES, citing Virgil <i>G</i> I 50-52 'at prius
ignotum ferro quam scindimus aequor, / uentos et uarium caeli
praediscere <i>morem</i> / cura sit' and Statius <i>Sil</i> III ii 87 'quos tibi
currenti praeceps gerat Hadria <i>mores</i>'. The second passage is not to
the point, since it means 'what sort of obedience to your wishes do you
expect from the Adriatic as you make your voyage'. In any case,
Professor R. J. Tarrant points out to me the poor logic of Merkel's
proposed text: Ovid is deriving the <i>natura loci</i> from its surroundings;
he should not now be saying that Boreas gets his <i>mores</i> from the area.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
The reading of the manuscripts seems acceptable enough if one accepts
Meynke's <i>polo</i> for <i>loco</i> ('he gathers strength from the nearby North
Pole'). For <i>sumit uires</i> compare <i>Met</i> VIII 882 (Achelous speaking)
'armenti modo dux <i>uires</i> in cornua <i>sumo</i>', <i>Met</i> XI 510-11 'ut
... solent <i>sumptis</i> incursu <i>uiribus</i> ire ... feri ... leones' and Hor
<i>Ep</i> I xviii 85 'neglecta solent incendia <i>sumere uires</i>'. Professor R.
J. Tarrant compares such phrases as <i>sumere iras</i> (<i>Met</i> II 175),
<i>animos</i> (<i>Met</i> III 544-45), and <i>cornua</i> (<i>AA</i> I 239, <i>Tr</i> IV ix 27).</p>

<p><b>42. POLO</b> <i>Meynke</i> LOCO <i>codd</i>. The pointlessness of <i>loco</i> is made clear
enough by Wheeler's 'and he takes on strength from a place nearer to
him'. Meynke's <i>polo</i> removes the difficulty, answers well to the
following 'at Notus, <i>aduerso</i> tepidum qui spirat ab <i>axe</i>', and is
supported by the language of <i>Met</i> II 173 'quaeque <i>polo</i> posita est
glaciali <i>proxima</i> Serpens', and <i>Fast</i> IV 575-76 (of Ceres) 'errat et
in caelo liquidique immunia ponti / adloquitur gelido <i>proxima</i> signa
<i>polo</i>'. For the corruption, compare the common misreading of <i>locum</i>
for <i>solum</i>.</p>

<p><b>43. ADVERSO ... AB AXE.</b> Ovid here seeks a contrast with <i>polo</i> in the
previous line; but clearly he means only that the south wind comes from
the opposite direction, not that it originates at the South Pole.</p>

<p>Bentley conjectured AVERSO for <i>aduerso</i>, and the two words are
obviously prone to interchange: compare <i>Tr</i> I iii 45 (of Ovid's wife,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
after his departure) 'multaque in auersos [<i>Heinsius</i>: aduersos <i>codd</i>]
effudit uerba Penates' and the variations among the manuscripts at
Virgil <i>G</i> I 218 'auerso ... astro', <i>Aen</i> XII 647 'auersa uoluntas', and
Sen <i>Tr</i> 1123 'auersa cingit campus' (on which see Housman 1076). But
<i>aduerso</i> 'opposite' seems to have the sense required here.</p>

<p><b>43. TEPIDVM QVI SPIRAT.</b> For the construction compare <i>Met</i> IX 661 'sub
aduentu <i>spirantis lene</i> Fauoni' and Avienus <i>Descr Orb</i> 847 'uel qua
<i>lene</i> Notus <i>spirat</i>'. The trivialized TEPIDVS QVI SPIRAT is found in
<i>MH<sup>2c</sup></i>. <i>Tepidus Notus</i> occurs four times in Ovid (<i>Am</i> I iv 12, I vii
56 &amp; II viii 20, and <i>Tr</i> III xii [xiii] 42).</p>

<p><b>44. LANGVIDIORQVE VENIT.</b> Compare <i>EP</i> II i 1-2 'Huc quoque Caesarei
peruenit fama triumphi, / <i>languida</i> quo fessi uix uenit <i>aura Noti</i>'.</p>

<p><b>46. AB AMNE.</b> Similar instrumental uses of <i>ab</i> at <i>Her</i> X 138 'tunicas
lacrimis sicut <i>ab imbre</i> graues', <i>AA</i> III 545 'ingenium placida
mollitur <i>ab arte</i>', <i>Met</i> I 65-66 'contraria tellus / nubibus assiduis
pluuiaque madescit ab Austro', <i>Met</i> IV 162-63 'pectus ... adhuc <i>a
caede</i> tepebat', and <i>Fast</i> V 323 'caelum nigrescit <i>ab Austris</i>'.</p>

<p><b>47-58.</b> For the lengthy catalogue, typical of Ovid, compare the listing
of Actaeon's dogs at <i>Met</i> III 206-25 (in particular at 217 'et Dromas
et Canache Sticteque et Tigris et Alce') and the catalogue of trees that
came to listen to Orpheus sing (<i>Met</i> X 90-107).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p><b>47. LYCVS.</b> A number of rivers had this name in the ancient world. Ovid
presumably means the Paphlagonian Lycus referred to by Virgil at <i>G</i> IV
366-67 'omnia sub magna labentia flumina terra / spectabat diuersa
locis, Phasimque Lycumque ...'.</p>

<p><b>47. SAGARIS.</b> The modern Sakarya; it flows into the Black Sea about 125
kilometres east of Istanbul. It is mentioned at Pliny <i>NH</i> VI 1 4
'Sangaris fluuius ex inclutis. oritur in Phrygia, accipit uastos amnes
... idem Sagiarius plerisque dictus'.</p>

<p><b>47. PENIVSQVE.</b> The 'flumen et oppidum Penius' are mentioned at Pliny
<i>NH</i> VI 14 as being in the region of the Caucasus on the Euxine coast;
nearby were 'multis nominibus Heniochorum gentes'. The river seems not
to be mentioned elsewhere in ancient literature.</p>

<p><b>47. HYPANISQVE.</b> The modern Bug empties into the Black Sea about 50
kilometres east of Odessa. It is mentioned again by Ovid at <i>Met</i> XV
285-86 'quid? non et Scythicis Hypanis de montibus ortus, / qui fuerat
dulcis, salibus uitiatur amaris?' and Virgil <i>G</i> IV 370 'saxosumque
sonans Hypanis'.</p>

<p><b>47. CALESQVE.</b> Isaac Vossius made this correction for the manuscripts'
CATESQVE (<i>I</i> has CHARESQVE) on the basis of 'Eustathio Scholiis in
Periegeten'. Heinsius aptly cited a description of the occasionally
violent flow of the river at Thucydides IV 75 2.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>As indicated by this passage, the modern Alapli flows into the Black Sea
near Ere&#287;li, about 200 kilometres east of Istanbul.</p>

<p><b>48. CREBRO VERTICE TORTVS HALYS.</b> An imitation of <i>Aen</i> VII 566-67
'fragosus / dat sonitum saxis et <i>torto uertice</i> torrens'. <i>Tortus</i> when
used of water generally refers to the disturbance caused by rowing
(<i>Fast</i> V 644; Catullus LXIV 13; <i>Aen</i> III 208).</p>

<p><b>48. HALYS.</b> The modern Kizil Irmak flows into the Black Sea about 600
kilometres east of Istanbul. Andr&eacute; compares Apollonius' description of
the river (II 366-67) '&#8165;&#959;&#945;&#8054; &#7949;&#955;&#965;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#964;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#8150;&#959; / &#948;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#957;
&#7952;&#961;&#949;&#973;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953;'.</p>

<p><b>49-50.</b> The three rivers mentioned in these lines are all named for their
swiftness.</p>

<p><b>49. PARTHENIVSQVE RAPAX.</b> The modern Bartin flows into the Black Sea
about 280 kilometres east of Istanbul and about 240 kilometres west of
Sinop. It is in fact a very calm river: this information was available
to Ovid from Apollonius II 936-37 '&#928;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#949;&#957;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#959; &#8165;&#959;&#8048;&#962;

(cited by Andr&eacute;).</p>

<p><b>49. VOLVENS SAXA.</b> Similar phrasing at <i>Met</i> VIII 552-53 '[undae ...]
ferre trabes solidas obliquaque <i>uoluere</i> magno / murmure <i>saxa</i>
solent'.</p>

<p><b>49. CINAPSES</b> <i>BC</i> CINAPSIS <i>L</i> TYNAPSES <i>H</i> CINASPES <i>FIT</i> NIPHATES <i>M</i>.
Editors read CYNAPSES; but since the river is not otherwise known,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
restoration is dangerous. <i>M</i>'s reading looks like an interpolation from
Lucan III 245 'Armeniusque tenens <i>uoluentem saxa</i> Niphaten' (cited by
Micyllus).</p>

<p><b>50. NVLLO TARDIOR</b> = <i>uelocior omni</i>; Andr&eacute; mistranslates 'le plus lent
des fleuves'. Compare <i>Tr</i> I v 1 'O mihi post nullos umquam [<i>uar</i> ullos
numquam] memorande sodales' and <i>EP</i> I iii 65-66 'Zmyrna uirum tenuit,
non Pontus et hostica tellus, / paene <i>minus nullo</i> Zmyrna petenda
loco'.</p>

<p><b>50. TYRAS.</b> The modern Dnestr flows into the Black Sea about fifty miles
south of Odessa; near its mouth is the city of Ovidiopol. The river is
briefly mentioned at Pliny <i>NH</i> IV 82 &amp; 93, and at Mela II 7, where it
is called the 'Tyra'; this however seems to be a scribal error induced
by the following <i>separat</i>.</p>

<p><b>51. THERMODON.</b> The modern Terme flows into the Black Sea about 100
kilometres southeast of the mouth of the Kizil Irmak (Halys). It was
conventional to mention the Amazons in connection with the river (<i>Met</i>
XII 611, <i>Aen</i> XI 659-60, Prop III xiv 13-14, Ammianus Marcellinus XXII
8 17). Professor E. Fantham suggests to me that Ovid may here be
providing Albinovanus with material for the part of his <i>Theseid</i>
dealing with Theseus' expedition against the Amazons.</p>

<p>Ovid also mentions the Thermodon at <i>Met</i> I 248-49 (the story of
Phaethon) 'arsit et Euphrates Babylonius, arsit Orontes / Thermodonque
citus Gangesque et Phasis et Hister'. As in the present distich, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
Thermodon and Phasis, both prominent in mythology, are mentioned
together.</p>

<p><b>51. TVRMAE</b> <i>BCM</i> TVRBAE <i>FHILT</i>. There is a similar variation among the
manuscripts at <i>AA</i> III l-2 'Arma dedi Danais in Amazonas; arma
supersunt / quae tibi dem et <i>turmae</i>, Penthesilea, tuae'. From other
descriptions of the Amazons, the Auctor Electorum Etonensium aptly
compares Val Fl IV 603 (<i>cateruas</i>) and 607 (<i>turma</i>); compare as well
Statius <i>Sil</i> I vi 56 (<i>turmas</i>). It is possible that <i>turma</i> should be
read at Prop III xiv 13-14 'qualis Amazonidum nudatis bellica mammis /
Thermodontiacis <i>turba</i> lauatur aquis'; but this would make <i>bellica</i>
redundant.</p>

<p><b>53. BORYSTHENIO ... AMNE</b> = <i>Bor&#121;&#773;sth&#277;n&#275;</i>. The river is the modern Dnepr,
which flows into the Black Sea about 120 kilometres east of Odessa,
about 50 kilometres east of the mouth of the Bug (Hypanis). For the
metrical device here employed, compare Prop II vii 17-18 'hinc etenim
tantum meruit mea gloria nomen, / gloria ad hibernos lata
<i>Borysthenidas</i>', Avienus <i>Descr Orb</i> 448 'inde <i>Borysthenii</i> uis sese
<i>fluminis</i> effert' &amp; 721 'ora <i>Borysthenii</i> qua <i>fluminis</i> in mare
uergunt'.</p>

<p><b>53. LIQVIDISSIMVS</b> is not found elsewhere in Ovid.</p>

<p><b>53. DIRAPSES.</b> The river is not mentioned elsewhere.</p>

<p><b>54. MELANTHVS.</b> The modern Melet Irmak flows into the Black Sea about 25
kilometres west of Trabzon (Trapezus). It is mentioned in passing at
Pliny <i>NH</i> VI 11.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p><b>55-56. QVIQVE DVAS TERRAS, ASIAM CADMIQVE SOROREM, / SEPARAT ET CVRSVS
INTER VTRAMQVE FACIT.</b> The Tanais (Don) is named as the border between
Europe and Asia by Pliny (<i>NH</i> IV 78) and Avienus (<i>Descr Orb</i> 28 &amp;
861). Compare as well Lucan III 272-76 'qua uertice lapsus / Riphaeo
Tanais diuersi nomina mundi / imposuit ripis Asiaeque et terminus idem /
Europae, mediae dirimens confinia terrae, / nunc hunc, nunc illum, qua
flectitur, ampliat orbem'.</p>

<p>Vibius Sequester (<i>Geog Lat min</i> [Riese] p. 212) has an entry 'Hypanis
Scythiae qui, ut ait Gallus "uno tellures diuidit amne duas": Asiam enim
ab Europa separat'. The Hypanis cannot be the river Ovid is here
referring to, for it has already been mentioned in 47; but, as Lenz saw,
the line from Gallus could well have been in Ovid's mind as he wrote
this passage. Professor R. J. Tarrant notes that the extraordinary
<i>Cadmique sororem</i> could well be a borrowing from the earlier poet.</p>

<p><b>57-58. INTER MAXIMVS OMNES / CEDERE DANVVIVS SE TIBI, NILE, NEGAT.</b> A
similar conjunction at <i>Tr</i> III x 27-28 'ipse, papyrifero qui non
angustior amne, / miscetur uasto multa per ora freto'. Herodotus
compares the courses of the Nile and the Danube, concluding '&#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#925;&#949;&#8150;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#959;&#954;&#941;&#969; &#948;&#953;&#8048; &#960;&#940;&#963;&#951;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#923;&#953;&#946;&#973;&#951;&#962; &#948;&#953;&#949;&#958;&#953;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#7952;&#958;&#953;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8183; &#7996;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#8179;'
(II 34), referring to the length of the rivers, however,
rather than their volume of discharge. At <i>NQ</i> III 22 Seneca mentions
the belief of some that because of their large size and the fact that
their sources were both unknown the Nile and the Danube must both have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
been formed at the creation of the world, unlike other rivers. At IV 1
1-2 he argues against those who equated the two rivers, pointing out
that the source of the Danube was known to be in Germany, and that the
two rivers flood at different times of the year.</p>

<p><b>59. COPIA TOT LATICVM QVAS AVGET ADVLTERAT AQVAS.</b> The comparative
freshness of the waters of the Black Sea was well known in antiquity.
Besides the passages cited at 37-38, see Polybius IV 42 3 and
Philostratus <i>Imag</i> I 13 7.</p>

<p><b>61-62. QVIN ETIAM, STAGNO SIMILIS PIGRAEQVE PALVDI, / CAERVLEVS VIX EST
DILVITVRQVE COLOR.</b> Ovid's drinking water was, on the other hand, rather
brackish: 'est in aqua dulci non inuidiosa uoluptas: / aequoreo bibitur
cum sale mixta palus' (<i>EP</i> II vii 73-74).</p>

<p><b>63. INNATAT VNDA FRETO DVLCIS.</b> Similar wording at Macrobius <i>Sat</i> VII 12
32 'superficies maris, cui dulces aquae <i>innatant</i>, congelascit'.</p>

<p><b>64. PONDVS</b> <i>B<sup>1</sup>CMFHT</i> NOMEN <i>ILB<sup>2</sup></i>. Wakefield conjectured MOMEN on the
basis of Lucretius VI 473-74 'quo magis ad nubis augendas multa uidentur
/ posse quoque e salso consurgere momine ponti'. But <i>pondus</i> seems
appropriate to the context in a way that <i>momen</i> 'heaving' does not.
<i>Nomen habe(n)t</i> is a frequent line-ending in Ovid, occurring some
twenty-five times (once in <i>Her</i> XVI). <i>Proprium nomen</i> occurs in Ovid
at <i>Fast</i> V 191-92 (Ovid is addressing Flora) 'ipsa doce quae sis.
hominum sententia fallax: / optima tu <i>proprii nominis</i> auctor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span> eris'
and <i>EP</i> I viii 13-14 'Caspius Aegissos, de se si credimus ipsis, /
condidit et <i>proprio nomine</i> dixit opus'. The phrase would have been
very familiar to the scribes from grammatical treatises ('proper noun').
A combination of these circumstances no doubt induced the error.</p>

<p>Professor A. Dalzell suggests to me that <i>momen</i> is perhaps correct, the
notion being that the salt water keeps moving, and so does not freeze.
<i>Pondus</i> would then be a (mistaken) gloss that has displaced <i>momen</i>
from the text; <i>nomen</i> would be a simple misreading of <i>momen</i>.</p>

<p><b>66. CERTIS ... MODIS.</b> 'Metre'; compare <i>Fast</i> III 388 'ad <i>certos</i> uerba
canenda <i>modos</i>', Tib II i 51-52 'agricola ... primum ... cantauit <i>certo</i>
rustica uerba <i>pede</i>' and Manilius III 35 '<i>pedibus</i> ... iungere
<i>certis</i>'.</p>

<p><b>67. DETINVI ... TEMPVS, CVRASQVE FEFELLI</b> <i>excerpta Politiani</i> DETINVI
... TEMPVS CVRAMQVE FEFELLI <i>LT</i> DETINVI ... CVRAS TEMPVSQVE FEFELLI
<i>BCMFHI</i>. <i>Tempus fallere</i> 'make time pass unnoticed' is perfectly
acceptable Latin; compare <i>Tr</i> III iii 11-12 'non qui labentia tarde /
<i>tempora</i> narrando <i>fallat</i> amicus adest', <i>Her</i> I 9-10 'nec mihi
quaerenti spatiosam <i>fallere noctem</i> / lassaret uiduas pendula tela
manus', <i>Met</i> VIII 651 'interea medias <i>fallunt</i> sermonibus <i>horas</i>',
<i>Tr</i> IV x 112-14 'tristia ... carmine fata leuo. / quod quamuis nemo est
cuius referatur ad aures, / sic tamen absumo <i>decipioque diem</i>', and
<i>Her</i> XIX 37-38 'tortaque uersato ducentes stamina fuso / feminea tardas
<i>fallimus</i> arte <i>moras</i>'. The difficulty with the manuscript reading in
the present passage is that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span> <i>detinui curas</i> is without parallel.
Heinsius therefore accepted Politian's reading, citing in its support
<i>Met</i> I 682-83 'sedit Atlantiades et euntem multa loquendo / <i>detinuit</i>
sermone <i>diem</i>'. The Auctor Electorum Etonensium objected that <i>detinui
tempus</i> was inappropriate: 'poeta tempus detinere noluit, quod scilicet
per se morari atque haerere uidebatur inuisum'. He conjectured DISTINVI
CVRAS and Burman DIMINVI CVRAS, which he later found in one of his
manuscripts. But <i>detinere</i> here can have the same meaning 'occupy, keep
busy' as it has at the <i>Metamorphoses</i> passage, where A. G. Lee cites
the present passage (with Politian's reading) and <i>Tr</i> V vii 39
'<i>detineo studiis animum</i> falloque dolores'.</p>

<p>The interchange of adjoining metrically and grammatically equivalent
substantives is very common.</p>

<p><b>71. THESEA.</b> For Theseus as the type of loyalty, compare <i>Tr</i> I iii 66 'o
mihi Thesea pectora iuncta fide!', I v 19-20, I ix 31-32, V iv 25-26
(Ovid's letter speaking) 'teque Menoetiaden, te qui comitatus Oresten, /
te uocat <i>Aegiden</i> Euryalumque suum', and <i>EP</i> II iii 43, II vi 26 &amp; III
ii 33-34 'occidit et Theseus et qui comitauit Oresten; / sed tamen in

(Gow) there is a pairing of Theseus/Pirithous and Orestes/Pylades
similar to what we find in Ovid.</p>

<p><b>72. TITVLOS.</b> 'Claims to glory'; compare <i>Met</i> VII 448-49 (to Theseus)

reading, <i>tanto quantus</i>, can be construed: Professor E. Fantham
translates 'a man so great as should have been sung with this mighty
style'. This however subordinates Theseus to Albinovanus, while the
purpose of the line is to emphasize Theseus' greatness. <i>Tanto quanto</i>
is generally printed: it is acceptable enough (compare <i>EP</i> II ix 11-12
'regia, crede mihi, res est succurrere lapsis, / conuenit et <i>tanto</i>,
<i>quantus</i> es ipse, uiro'), but is very weakly attested, and does not
explain the transmitted reading. I have printed <i>L</i>'s <i>tantus quanto</i>;
<i>quanto tantus</i> might also be read.</p>

<p><b>76. QVANTO ... ORE.</b> For <i>os</i> 'grandness of utterance' Professor R. J.

<p><b>79-82.</b> Professor R. J. Tarrant points out to me how the example of
Theseus balances the comparison with Ulysses at the start of the poem.
Earlier Ovid argued against a difference of scale between his own case
and the mythic figure's: here he insists on it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p><b>79. HOSTES ... DOMANDI.</b> For lists of these enemies, see <i>Her</i> II 69-70

mentions the club of Hercules about a dozen times.</p>

<p><b>80. VIX ILLI.</b> For <i>uix</i> 'with difficulty' <i>OLD uix</i> 1 cites <i>Fast</i> I 508
'uix est Euandri uixque retenta manu'.</p>

<p>Most editors print VIX VLLI (<i>BCT</i>), which is possible enough. <i>Vix
illi</i> seems rather more forceful, however, as making the point that even
Theseus was able to make the dangerous journey only with difficulty, and
that before him the road was impassable. Compare <i>Met</i> VII 443-44 'tutus
ad Alcathoen, Lelegeia moenia, limes / composito Scirone patet'.</p>

<p><b>81. OPEROSA.</b> The word in the sense 'troublesome' seems confined to prose
except for this passage and <i>Her</i> II 63-64 'fallere credentem non est

<p><b>83. PERSTAS</b> <i>IPF<sup>2ul</sup></i>. Compare <i>Tr</i> IV i 19-20 'me quoque Musa leuat

and <i>Tr</i> V xiv 19-20 'quae ne quis possit temeraria dicere, persta
[<i>uar</i> praesta] / et pariter serua meque piamque fidem'. PERSTAS, the
reading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span> of most manuscripts, would have no acceptable meaning in the
present passage; it has no object, and the intransitive meaning, 'stand
out', is clearly inappropriate. The error may have been induced by <i>Tr</i>
IV v 23-24 'teque, quod est rarum, <i>praesta</i> constanter ad omne /
indeclinatae munus amicitiae'; more probably, it is an aftereffect of
<i>praestandus</i> in 81.</p>

<p><b>83. INDECLINATVS</b> governs <i>amico</i>. The only other instance of the word in
classical Latin seems to be <i>Tr</i> IV v 24, quoted at the end of the last
note.</p>

<p><b>84. LINGVA QVERENTE.</b> Ovid elsewhere uses persons as the subject of
<i>queri</i>, except for similar uses of metonymy at xiv 26 '<i>littera</i> de

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XI_To_Gallio" id="XI_To_Gallio"></a>XI. To Gallio</h2>


<p>The poem is a letter of condolence to the famous rhetor Junius Gallio,
an old friend of Ovid (see at 1). Ovid starts the poem by saying that
Gallio should certainly be mentioned in his poetry, because he helped
Ovid at the time of his catastrophe (1-4). This one misfortune should
have been enough for him, but now he has lost his wife (5-8). Ovid wept
on receiving the news, but will not attempt to comfort him, since by now
the grief is in the past, and he would risk renewing it (9-20). Also
(and he hopes this will turn out to be the case), Gallio may already
have remarried (21-22).</p>

<p>The poem is one of the shortest in Ovid's canon (<i>Am</i> II iii is
shorter), and has few parallels with his other poems. The one that comes
closest is <i>EP</i> I ix, addressed to Cotta Maximus, which describes Ovid's
reaction on hearing of the death of Celsus. There are some verbal
parallels as well with <i>EP</i> I iii, Ovid's answer to Rufinus' letter of
consolation on his exile. In the commentary I cite passages from Ser.
Sulpicius Rufus' famous letter to Cicero on the death of his daughter
Tullia (<i>Fam</i> IV v) and from Seneca's treatises of consolation; Ovid was
clearly making use of the common topics of the genre.</p>

<p><b>1. GALLIO.</b> Junius Gallio<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>, adoptive father of the younger Seneca's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
elder brother, is often cited by the elder Seneca, who considered him
one of the four supreme orators of his time (<i>Contr</i> X praef. 13). At
<i>Suas</i> III 6-8, Seneca discusses Gallio's fondness for the Virgilian
phrase <i>plena deo</i> (which, oddly, is not found in our text of the poet),
and quotes Gallio as saying that his friend Ovid was also very fond of
the phrase. Quintilian and Tacitus did not share Seneca's high opinion
of Gallio: Quintilian criticizes the lack of restraint in his style (IX
ii 92), while at <i>Dial</i> 26 1 Tacitus has Messalla say how he prefers 'G.
Gracchi impetum aut L. Crassi maturitatem quam calamistros ['curling
irons' = 'excessive ornament'] Maecenatis aut tinnitus Gallionis'.</p>

<p>In AD 32 Gallio proposed in the Senate that ex-members of the Praetorian
guard be permitted to use the theatre seats reserved for members of the
equestrian order; this resulted in a bitter and sarcastic letter from
Tiberius to the Senate attacking Gallio's presumption; he was first
exiled, then brought back to custody in Rome after it was decided that
Lesbos, chosen by him, was too pleasant a place of exile (Tac <i>Ann</i> VI
3; Dio LXVIII 18 4).</p>

<p><b>1. EXCVSABILE.</b> The word is extremely rare, and is not found in verse
outside the <i>Ex Ponto</i>: compare I vii 41-42 'quod nisi delicti pars
<i>excusabilis</i> esset, / parua relegari poena futura fuit' and III ix
33-34 'nil tamen e scriptis magis <i>excusabile</i> nostris / quam sensus
cunctis paene quod unus inest'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p><b>2. HABVISSE</b> could have the usual past sense of the perfect infinitive,
but more probably is equivalent to <i>habere</i>: compare ix 20 'gauderem
lateris non <i>habuisse</i> locum' and see at viii 82 <i>imposuisse</i> (<a href="#Page_282">p 282</a>).</p>

<p><b>3-4. CAELESTI CVSPIDE FACTA ... VVLNERA.</b> 'Wounds inflicted by no human
weapon'. The <i>cuspis</i> is attributed to Mars at <i>Am</i> I i 11, to Neptune
at <i>Met</i> XII 580, and to Athena at <i>Fast</i> VI 655. At Sen <i>Ag</i> 368-71
'tuque, o magni nata Tonantis / inclita Pallas, / quae Dardanias saepe
petisti / cuspide terras', R. J. Tarrant cites <i>HF</i> 563 (Dis), <i>HF</i> 904
&amp; <i>Phaed</i> 755 (Bacchus), <i>HO</i> 156 (Hercules), and Juvenal II 130 (Mars).
Professor Tarrant points out to me that the <i>cuspis</i> does not seem to be
attributed to Jupiter, no doubt because the <i>fulmen</i> was too firmly
established as his weapon. Ovid is therefore not making his customary
specific equation of Augustus with Jupiter.</p>

<p><b>4. FOVISTI.</b> <i>Fouere</i> was a technical term in medicine for bathing
something in a liquid (Cato <i>Agr</i> 157 4, Celsus IV 2 4, Columella VI 12
4). The word occurs in this sense in poetry: see <i>Met</i> II 338-39 'nomen
... in marmore lectum / perfudit lacrimis et aperto pectore <i>fouit</i>',
<i>Met</i> VIII 654 (perhaps spurious; the passage is one where textual
doublets occur), <i>Met</i> X 186-87 (Hyacinthus has just been struck by
Apollo's discus) 'deus conlapsos ... excipit artus, / et modo te
<i>refouet</i>, modo tristia uulnera siccat', <i>Met</i> XV 532 'et lacerum <i>foui</i>
Phlegethontide corpus in unda', and <i>Aen</i> XII 420 '<i>fouit</i> ea uulnus
lympha longaeuus Iapyx'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<p><b>5. RAPTI.</b> The word could be taken to mean 'dead'; compare xvi 1 'Nasonis
... rapti', where the context shows this is the meaning, and <i>EP</i> I ix
1-2 (to Cotta Maximus) 'Quae mihi de <i>rapto</i> tua uenit epistula Celso, /
protinus est lacrimis umida facta meis'. For the similarly ambiguous use
of <i>ademptus</i>, see at vi 49 <i>qui me doluistis ademptum</i> (<a href="#Page_243">p 243</a>).</p>

<p><b>6. QVOD QVERERERE.</b> For the phrase, compare <i>Am</i> I iv 23-24 (Ovid is
listing the signals his girl should use at the dinner-table) 'si quid
erit de me tacita <i>quod</i> mente <i>queraris</i>, / pendeat extrema mollis ab
aure manus', <i>Tr</i> V i 37 (of Fortune) '<i>quod querar</i>, illa mihi pleno de
fonte ministrat', <i>Her</i> XIX 79, and <i>Her</i> XX 34 &amp; 94.</p>

<p><b>7-8. PVDICA / CONIVGE.</b> Being <i>pudica</i>, she deserved to
survive&mdash;Professor E. Fantham points out to me here Ovid's use of what
could be called the <i>quid profuit</i> topic.</p>

<p>The reference to Gallio's wife seems rather cool in tone. For some very
warm descriptions of recently deceased wives, see Lattimore 275-80.</p>

<p><b>8. NON HABVERE NEFAS.</b> This sense of <i>habere</i>, very common in prose, does
not seem to occur elsewhere in Ovid; but Professor R. J. Tarrant cites
<i>Aen</i> V 49-50 'dies ... adest quem semper acerbum, / semper honoratum
... <i>habebo</i>'.</p>

<p><b>9. LVCTVS</b> = <i>causae luctus</i>. Other instances of this sense of <i>luctus</i>,
which seems to be confined to poetical passages of great emotional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
content, at <i>Met</i> I 654-55 (Inachus to Io) 'tu non inuenta reperta /
<i>luctus</i> eras leuior', <i>Met</i> IX 155, and <i>Aen</i> VI 868 (Aeneas has just
seen Marcellus) 'o nate, ingentem <i>luctum</i> ne quaere tuorum'.</p>

<p><b>10. LECTAQVE CVM LACRIMIS SVNT TVA DAMNA MEIS.</b> Compare <i>EP</i> I ix 1-2
(quoted above at 5 <i>rapti</i>) and <i>Fam</i> IV v 1 (Ser. Sulpicius Rufus to
Cicero) 'Postea quam mihi renuntiatum est de obitu Tulliae, filiae tuae,
sane quam pro eo ac debui grauiter molesteque tuli communemque eam
calamitatem existimaui'.</p>

<p><b>10. TVA DAMNA.</b> Compare <i>Fast</i> II 835-36 (Lucretia has just killed
herself) 'ecce super corpus <i>communia damna</i> gementes / obliti decoris
uirque paterque iacent' and <i>Tr</i> IV iii 35 'tu uero tua damna dole,
mitissima coniunx'.</p>

<p><b>11. SED NEQVE SOLARI PRVDENTEM STVLTIOR AVSIM.</b> Compare <i>Fam</i> IV v 6
'plura me ad te de hac re scribere pudet, ne uidear <i>prudentiae</i> tuae
diffidere'. For the opposite reasoning, see Sen <i>Cons Marc</i> 1 1 'Nisi
te, Marcia, scirem tam longe ab infirmitate muliebris animi quam a
ceteris uitiis recessisse et mores tuos uelut aliquod antiquum exemplar
aspici, non auderem obuiam ire dolori tuo'.</p>

<p><b>12. VERBAQVE DOCTORVM NOTA.</b> Compare <i>EP</i> I iii 27-30 (to Rufinus, who
has written him a letter of consolation on his exile) 'cum bene
firmarunt animum <i>praecepta</i> iacentem, / sumptaque sunt nobis pectoris
arma tui, / rursus amor patriae <i>ratione ualentior omni</i>, / quod tua<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
fecerunt scripta retexit opus', and Sen <i>Cons Marc</i> 2 1 'scio a
praeceptis incipere omnes qui monere aliquem uolunt, in exemplis
desinere'.</p>

<p><b>13-14. FINITVMQVE TVVM ... DOLOREM / IPSA IAM PRIDEM SVSPICOR ESSE MORA.</b>
Compare <i>EP</i> I iii 25-26 'cura quoque interdum nulla medicabilis arte
est&mdash; / aut, ut sit, longa est extenuanda mora', <i>Fam</i> IV v 6 'nullus
dolor est quem non longinquitas temporis minuat ac molliat', and <i>Cons
Marc</i> 8 1 'dolorem dies longa consumit'. For a variation of the theme,
see <i>Cons Marc</i> 1 6 'illud ipsum naturale remedium temporis, quod
maximas quoque aerumnas componit, in te una uim suam perdidit'.</p>

<p>The topic of time as the healer of pain is common in ancient literature
from New Comedy on: see Tarrant on Sen <i>Ag</i> 130 'quod ratio non quiit,
saepe sanauit mora', Otto <i>dies</i> 6, and Kassel 53.</p>

<p><b>13. SI NON RATIONE.</b> <i>Ratio</i> similarly used to counter strong emotion
(without success) at <i>EP</i> I iii 27-30 (quoted at 12), <i>Met</i> VII 10-11
(Medea falls in love with Jason) '<i>ratione</i> furorem / uincere non
poterat', and <i>Met</i> XIV 701-2 (similar phrasing for Iphis' falling in
love with Anaxarete).</p>

<p><b>14. IPSA ... MORA.</b> 'By the mere passage of time'.</p>

<p><b>15-16. DVM TVA PERVENIENS, DVM LITTERA NOSTRA RECVRRENS / TOT MARIA AC
TERRAS PERMEAT, ANNVS ABIT.</b> Similar phrasing at <i>EP</i> III iv 59-60 'dum
uenit huc rumor properataque carmina fiunt / factaque eunt ad uos, annus
abisse potest'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p><b>15. PERVENIENS</b> is my correction for the manuscripts' <i>peruenit</i>. The
perfect tense of <i>peruenit</i> conflicts with the following <i>permeat</i> and
<i>abit</i>. It might be argued that the perfect is acceptable, since Ovid is
speaking of a past event; but he would not have used the perfect of an
action which took place over a considerable period of time. For
<i>perueniens ... permeat</i> referring to a past event, compare Ovid's use of
the present <i>uenit</i> in the very similar passage <i>EP</i> III iv 59-60
(quoted at the end of the last note).</p>

<p>The postponement of <i>permeat</i> to the following line made the corruption
of <i>dum ... perueniens</i> to <i>dum ... peruenit</i> simple enough.</p>

<p><b>17. TEMPORIS OFFICIVM EST SOLACIA DICERE CERTI.</b> Here Ovid says that
words of comfort should not be offered too late; at <i>RA</i> 127-30 he says
they should not be offered too early: 'quis matrem, nisi mentis inops,
in funere nati / flere uetet? non hoc illa monenda loco est. / cum
dederit lacrimas animumque impleuerit aegrum, / ille dolor uerbis
emoderandus erit'.</p>

<p>For the same concern with time as in the present passage and medical
imagery similar to that in 19-20, see <i>Cons Marc</i> 1 8 and <i>Cons Hel</i> 1 2
'dolori tuo, dum recens saeuiret, sciebam occurrendum non esse, ne illum
ipsa solacia irritarent et accenderent; nam in morbis quoque nihil est
perniciosius quam immatura medicina. expectabam itaque, dum ipse uires
suas frangeret et ad sustinenda remedia mora mitigatus tangi se ac
tractari pateretur'. See as well the passages cited at Kassel 52-53:
from modern literature he quotes Sterne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span> <i>Tristram Shandy</i> III 29
'Before an affliction is <i>digested</i> consolation ever comes too
soon;&mdash;and after it is digested&mdash;it comes too late: so that you see
... there is but a mark between those two, as fine almost as a hair, for
a comforter to take aim at'.</p>

<p><b>18. DVM DOLOR IN CVRSV EST.</b> Compare <i>RA</i> 119 <i>'dum furor in cursu est</i>,
currenti cede furori' and <i>Met</i> XIII 508-10 (Hecuba speaking) '<i>in
cursuque meus dolor est</i>: modo maxima rerum ... nunc trahor exul, inops,
tumulis auulsa meorum'.</p>

<p><b>18. AEGER.</b> The substantive <i>aeger</i> is quite common in both verse and
prose, but always with the meaning 'physically ill'; even when used, as
here, with a transferred meaning, the sense of metaphor is still
present. Compare <i>RA</i> 313-14 'curabar propriis aeger Podalirius herbis,
/ et, fateor, medicus turpiter <i>aeger</i> eram', <i>EP</i> I iii 17 'non est in
medico semper releuetur ut <i>aeger</i>', and <i>EP</i> III iv 7-8 'firma ualent
per se, nullumque Machaona quaerunt; / ad medicam dubius confugit
<i>aeger</i> opem'.</p>

<p>The adjective, however, is used by the poets from Ennius on (<i>Sc</i> 254 &amp;
392 Vahlen<sup>3</sup>), particularly in the phrases <i>mens aegra</i> and <i>animus
aeger</i>, to indicate a state of mental anguish. Compare, from Ovid, <i>Tr</i>
III viii 33-34 'nec melius ualeo quam corpore mente, sed aegra est /
utraque pars aeque', <i>Tr</i> IV iii 21, IV vi 43 &amp; V ii 7, <i>EP</i> I iii 89-90
'uereor ne ... frustra ... iuuer admota perditus <i>aeger ope</i>', I v 18 &amp; I
vi 15 'tecum tunc aberant <i>aegrae solacia</i> mentis', and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span> <i>Ibis</i> 115;
from other poets, compare <i>Cons ad Liuiam</i> 395, Hor <i>Ep</i> I viii 8, and
<i>Aen</i> I 208 &amp; IV 35. The same use of the adjective is found occasionally
in the historians (Sallust <i>Iug</i> 71 2, Livy II 3 5, etc).</p>

<p><b>19. LONGA DIES</b> = <i>tempus</i>. Compare <i>Met</i> I 346, <i>Met</i> XIV 147-48 (the
Sibyl to Aeneas) 'tempus erit cum de tanto me corpore paruam / <i>longa
dies</i> faciet', and <i>Tr</i> I v 11-14 'spiritus et uacuas prius hic
tenuandus in auras / ibit ... quam subeant animo meritorum obliuia
nostro, / et <i>longa</i> pietas excidat ista <i>die</i>'.</p>

<p><b>19. VVLNERA MENTIS.</b> Ovid is fond of this metaphorical sense of <i>uulnus</i>;
see <i>Met</i> V 425-27 'Cyane ... inconsolabile <i>uulnus</i> / <i>mente</i> gerit
tacita', <i>Tr</i> IV iv 41-42 'neue retractando nondum coeuntia rumpam /
<i>uulnera</i>: uix illis proderit ipsa quies', <i>EP</i> I iii 87-88 'nec tamen
infitior, si possent nostra coire / <i>uulnera</i>, praeceptis posse coire
tuis', and <i>EP</i> I v 23 'parcendum est animo miserabile <i>uulnus</i>
habenti'. To judge from Seneca, the metaphor was usual in treatises of
consolation: 'antiqua mala in memoriam reduxi et, ut scires
[<i>Schultess</i>: uis scire <i>codd</i>] hanc quoque plagam esse sanandam,
ostendi tibi aeque magni <i>uulneris</i> cicatricem' (<i>Cons Marc</i> 1 5),
'itaque utcumque conabar manu super plagam meam imposita ad obliganda
<i>uulnera</i> uestra reptare' (<i>Cons Hel</i> 1 1).</p>

<p><b>20. FOVET</b> <i>Heinsius</i> MOVET <i>codd</i>. For the meaning of <i>fouet</i> see at 4
<i>fouisti</i> (<a href="#Page_361">p 361</a>). <i>Mouet</i> here is to some extent supported by Ovid's
use of such verbs as <i>tangere</i> and <i>tractare</i> in contexts like that of
the present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span> passage; compare <i>EP</i> I vi 21-22 'nec breue nec tutum
peccati quae sit origo / scribere; <i>tractari uulnera</i> nostra timent',
<i>EP</i> II vii 13, and <i>EP</i> III vii 25-26 'curando fieri quaedam maiora
uidemus / uulnera, quae melius non <i>tetigisse</i> fuit'. But <i>tractare</i> and
<i>tangere</i> are neutral in force, while <i>mouet</i> here would mean 'disturb',
as at Hor <i>Carm</i> III xx 1-2 'Non uides quanto <i>moueas</i> periclo, /
Pyrrhe, Gaetulae catulos leaenae?' and Lucan VIII 529-30 'bustum
cineresque <i>mouere</i> / Thessalicos audes bellumque in regna uocare?'. As
Professor R. J. Tarrant comments, if <i>mouet</i> were read in the present
passage, <i>intempestiue</i> would lose the appropriateness it has when
<i>fouet</i> is read: there is no proper time to "disturb" a wound.</p>

<p><b>20. NOVAT.</b> Similar phrasing at <i>Tr</i> II 209 'nam non sum tanti <i>renouem</i>
ut tua <i>uulnera</i>, Caesar' and <i>RA</i> 729-30 'admonitu refricatur amor,
<i>uulnusque nouatum</i> / scinditur'.</p>

<p><b>21. ADDE QVOD.</b> Professor E. Fantham points out to me how extraordinary
the occurrence of this phrase in the last distich of the poem is. Of the
twenty-five instances of the idiom in Ovid's poems<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>, none<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span> except the
present passage occur in the final distich of a poem or book. The other
examples all occur in the middle of an argument, or lead into another
distich containing a final injunction or proof of an argument. As
Professor J. N. Grant suggests to me, this poem therefore furnishes
another example of Ovid's favourite device of unexpectedly altering a
poem's tone in the final distich, for a discussion of which see at xiv
61-62 (<a href="#Page_427">p 427</a>).</p>

<p><b>21. MIHI</b> <i>BF<sup>1</sup></i> TIBI <i>MHILTF<sup>2</sup></i> <i>om C</i>. As Burman saw, <i>mihi</i> must be the
correct reading, the perfect subjunctive acting as a past optative:
'certe ego <i>mihi</i> praeferrem: utinam mihi, mentionem facienti noui tui
coniugii, uerum illud omen uenerit, neque fallar, sed tu iam uxorem
duxeris, ut ego uoueo'. <i>Tibi</i> is hardly possible, since an omen to
Gallio indicating that he had remarried would be superfluous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XII_To_Tuticanus" id="XII_To_Tuticanus"></a>XII. To Tuticanus</h2>


<p>Tuticanus<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> (known only from the <i>Ex Ponto</i>) seems from the testimony
of the poem (19-30) to have been a close friend of Ovid; he is mentioned
again at xiv 1-2 and xvi 27. It is reasonable to suppose that, like
Sextus Pompeius, he had previously been unwilling to allow Ovid to
mention him in his verse.</p>

<p>The poem opens with a discussion of the difficulty of fitting Tuticanus'
name into elegiac verse: Ovid could split the name between verses, or
alter the quantity of one or another of the name's syllables, but
neither procedure would be acceptable to Ovid or to his readers (1-18).
He has known Tuticanus since early youth; they assisted each other in
their verse (19-30). He is quite certain that Tuticanus will not desert
him (31-38). He should use his influence with Tiberius to assist Ovid;
but Ovid is so confused after his hardships that he cannot suggest
precisely what Tuticanus should do; he leaves this to Tuticanus'
judgment (39-50).</p>

<p>The appeal for assistance is a constant theme of the poetry of exile;
and the recalling of their assisting each other with their poetry is
paralleled by <i>EP</i> II iv, in which Ovid recalls how he used to submit
his verse to Atticus for criticism, and by <i>Tr</i> III vii, Ovid's letter
to his stepdaughter Perilla, whom he assisted when she first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span> began
writing verse. The opening discussion of the metrical difficulty of
Tuticanus' name finds parallels elsewhere in Latin and Greek literature
(see at 1-2), but is remarkable for its fullness. The explanation for
this fullness may well be Tuticanus' being a fellow poet: he would be
amused by the use of his own name for the witty discussion of the
handling of metrical difficulties with which he himself would be
familiar enough.</p>

<p><b>1-2. QVOMINVS IN NOSTRIS PONARIS, AMICE, LIBELLIS, / NOMINIS EFFICITVR
CONDICIONE TVI.</b> A constant problem for the Latin poets was the
impossibility of using words with cretic patterns (a long syllable,
followed by a short syllable, followed by another long syllable) in
hexameter or elegiac verse. The fact played an important part in
determining Latin poetic vocabulary; for instance, such an ordinary word
as <i>femina</i>, cretic in its oblique cases, is usually represented through
metonymy by such words as <i>nurus</i> and <i>mater</i>. Proper names presented a
special problem, which could however occasionally be solved through the
use of special forms or circumlocutions; hence such lines as 'cumque
<i>Borysthenio</i> liquidissimus <i>amne</i> [=Bor&#121;&#773;sth&#277;n&#275;] Dirapses' (x
53) and '<i>Scipiadas</i> [=Sc&#299;p&#301;&#333;nes], belli fulmen, Carthaginis
horror' (Lucretius III 1034). Sometimes, as in the present passage, such
avenues were not available, and the poet was simply unable to use the
name he wanted. From Greek authors Marx, commenting on Lucilius 228-29,
cites Critias fr. 5 '&#959;&#8016; &#947;&#940;&#961; &#960;&#969;&#962; &#7974;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8020;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945; &#7952;&#966;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#972;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#7952;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#8179;'
Archestratus fr. 29 (Brandt) '&#7984;&#967;&#952;&#973;&#959;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#958;&#951;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#8003;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#956;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#8179; &#959;&#8016; &#952;&#941;&#956;&#953;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#960;&#949;&#8150;&#957;'
and <i>Ep Gr</i> 616 (Kaibel) '&#959;&#8016; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#7952;&#957; &#7953;&#958;&#945;&#956;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7973;&#961;&#956;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#957;  &#964;&#959;&#8020;&#957;&#959;&#956;'  &#7952;&#956;&#972;&#957;'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span> In Latin, the best-known
reference to this difficulty is Hor <i>Sat</i> I v 86-87 'quattuor hinc
rapimur uiginti et milia raedis, / mansuri oppidulo, quod uersu dicere
non est'. On the passage Porphyrion comments 'Aequum Tuticum significat
[this is disputed by modern commentators, since the town's known
location does not fit with Horace's indication; no certain candidate has
been proposed], cuius nomen hexametro uersu compleri [<i>codd</i>: contineri
<i>fort legendum</i>] non potest. hoc autem sub exemplo Lucili posuit. nam
ille in sexto Saturarum [228-29 Marx] sic ait: "seruorum est festus dies
hic, / quem plane hexametro uersu non dicere possis"'. In his comment on
the passage from Horace, Lejay cites Martial IX xi 10-17
(Martial wanted to mention Flavius &#276;&#259;r&#301;nus, whose name
starts with three consecutive short vowels) 'nomen nobile, molle,
delicatum / uersu dicere non rudi uolebam: / sed tu, syllaba contumax,
rebellas. / dicunt Eiarinon tamen poetae, / sed Graeci, quibus est nihil
negatum, / et quos &#7950;&#961;&#949;&#962; &#7948;&#961;&#949;&#962; decet sonare: / nobis non licet
esse tam disertis / qui Musas colimus seueriores', Rutilius Namatianus
419-22 (of V&#335;l&#365;s&#301;anus [short 'o', 'u', and 'i']
Rufius) 'optarem uerum complecti carmine nomen, / sed quosdam refugit
regula dura pedes. / cognomen uersu ueheris
[<i>Pr&eacute;chac</i>: ueneris <i>uel</i> uenens <i>codd</i>], carissime Rufi; / illo te
dudum pagina nostra canit', and Apollinaris Sidonius <i>Carm</i> XXIII 485-86
'horum nomina cum referre uersu / affectus cupiat, metrum recusat'.</p>

<p>Professor C. P. Jones cites the discussion at Pliny <i>Ep</i> VIII iv 3-4.
Pliny, writing to Caninius, who is composing a poem in Greek<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span> on the
Dacian war, discusses the difficulty of using <i>barbara et fera nomina</i>
in the poem: 'sed ... si datur Homero et mollia uocabula et Graeca ad
leuitatem uersus contrahere extendere inflectere, cur tibi similis
audentia, praesertim non delicata sed necessaria, non detur?'.</p>

<p>For a further discussion of the topic, see L. Radermacher, "Das Epigramm
des Didius", <i>SAWW</i> 170,9 [1912] 1-31.</p>

<p><b>1. QVOMINVS</b> is rare in Augustan verse; but compare <i>AA</i> II 720 'non
obstet tangas quominus illa [<i>sc</i> loca] pudor'.</p>

<p><b>3. AVT</b> <i>BC</i> AST <i>MFHILT</i>. The false reading was probably induced by a
failure to understand the meaning of <i>aut</i> 'otherwise', for which
compare iii 21 '<i>aut</i> age, dic aliquam quae te mutauerit iram', <i>Met</i>
VII 699, <i>Met</i> X 50-52 'hanc [<i>sc</i> Eurydicen] simul et legem Rhodopeius
accipit heros, / ne flectat retro sua lumina donec Auernas / exierit
ualles; <i>aut</i> inrita dona futura', and <i>Tr</i> I viii 43-45 'quaeque tibi
... dedit nutrix ubera, tigris erat. / <i>aut</i> mala nostra minus quam nunc
aliena putares'.</p>

<p><b>2. CONDICIONE.</b> 'Nature'. Compare Lucretius II 300-1 'et quae consuerint
gigni gignentur eadem / <i>condicione</i> et erunt et crescent uique
ualebunt'.</p>

<p><b>4. SI MODO.</b> 'If, that is ...' Compare 43-44 'quid mandem quaeris?
peream nisi dicere uix est, / <i>si modo</i> qui periit ille perire potest'.</p>

<p><b>5. LEX PEDIS.</b> 'The rules of metre'. <i>Lex</i> used similarly at Hor <i>Carm</i>
IV ii 10-12 'per audaces noua dithyrambos / uerba deuoluit numerisque<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
fertur / <i>lege</i> solutis', Cic <i>Or</i> 58 'uersibus est certa quaedam et
definita <i>lex</i>', and Columella XI 1 1.</p>

<p><b>5. FORTVNAQVE.</b> The sense of the word is difficult. It seems, as
Professor R. J. Tarrant notes, to combine the idea of 'condition, state'
(compare for example <i>Aen</i> II 350 'quae sit rebus <i>fortuna</i> uidetis')
with that of 'unfortunate circumstances', giving the general sense 'the
fact that you have the bad luck to possess a metrically impossible
name'. Three lines before, Ovid used <i>nominis ... condicione tui</i>; and in
the present line he seems to have been influenced by the common phrase
<i>condicio et fortuna</i>, 'allotted circumstances of life', for which
compare Cic <i>Off</i> I 41 'est autem infima <i>condicio et fortuna</i>
seruorum', <i>Mil</i> 92 'in infimi generis hominum <i>condicione atque
fortuna</i>'. At <i>II Verr</i> I 81 Cicero similarly adapts the expression to
suit his context: 'Lampsacenis ... populi Romani <i>condicione</i> sociis,
<i>fortuna</i> seruis, uoluntate supplicibus'.</p>

<p><b>7. NOMEN SCINDERE.</b> That is, split the name so that the hexameter
(<i>uersus prior</i>) would end in <i>T&#363;t&#301;-</i> and the following pentameter
(<i>uersus minor</i>) begin with <i>-c&#257;n&#365;s</i>. Such word-divisions are not
permissible in Augustan verse; from earlier poetry Professor C. P. Jones
cites Ennius <i>Ann</i> 609 Vahlen<sup>3</sup> 'saxo <i>cere</i> comminuit <i>brum</i>'.</p>

<p><b>8. HOC</b> = <i>nomine tuo</i>.</p>

<p><b>9-14.</b> Ovid lists the three possible ways of scanning the name so as to
remove the cretic: <i>T&#363;t&#301;c&#259;nus</i>, <i>T&#365;t&#301;c&#257;nus</i>, and
<i>T&#363;t&#299;c&#257;nus</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>

<p><b>9. MORATVR</b> = <i>longa est</i>. The <i>TLL</i> cites Velius Longus VII 55 5 Keil
'hanc ... naturam esse quarundam litterarum, ut <i>morentur</i> et
enuntiatione sonum detineant'.</p>

<p><b>11. ET</b> <i>BCHI<sup>ac</sup>LT</i> NON <i>M</i> NEC <i>FI<sup>pc</sup></i>. <i>Nec</i>, printed by some editors,
cannot by itself be correct, for there is no negative with the
corresponding <i>producatur</i> in the following distich. A negative is
implicitly supplied for <i>potes ... uenire</i> and <i>producatur</i> by 15-16 'his
ego si uitiis ...', but Professor R. J. Tarrant is possibly right to
suggest that <i>nec</i> should be read both here and (replacing <i>aut</i>) at the
beginning of 13.</p>

<p>W. A. Camps (<i>CQ</i> n.s. IV [1954] 206-7) has pointed out that it is
somewhat odd that 'The first two possibilities are introduced, in lines
7 and 9, in terms that disclaim them at once' and that 'the third and
fourth possibilities are added without disclaimer ... in terms that would
be quite appropriate to serious suggestions'. He suggests reading <i>at</i>,
so that 11-12 represent an imaginary rejoinder to Ovid's rejection of
the possibilities already suggested; Ovid's rejoinder is given at 15
'his ego si uitiis ...'. But <i>at potes</i> is difficult: Ovid could have
written 'at, puto, potes', speaking in his own person to raise an
objection he would then counter, or he could have represented Tuticanus
as saying 'at ... possum'; but it is hard to see how he could have
written 'at potes'.</p>

<p><b>13. PRODVCATVR</b> <i>MHI</i> VT DVCATVR <i>LTB<sup>2</sup>F<sup>2ul</sup></i> VT DICATVR <i>B<sup>1</sup>CF<sup>1</sup></i>.
<i>Producere</i> is the correct technical term for 'lengthen'; compare
Quintilian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span> VII ix 13 '<i>productio</i> quoque in scripto et correptio in
dubio relicta causa est ambiguitatis' &amp; IX iii 69 'uoces ['words']
... <i>productione</i> tantum uel correptione mutatae'. <i>Vt ducatur</i> is
unlikely to be right. <i>Ducatur</i> could certainly stand for <i>producatur</i>
(although this would destroy the balance with the following
<i>correptius</i>), but the verb is clearly indicated as a potential
subjunctive by the preceding <i>potes ... uenire</i>; and <i>ut</i> (which would in
any case be taken as correlative with <i>ut</i> in line 12) cannot stand with
this construction. <i>Vt dicatur</i>, Ehwald's preferred reading ('dicatur et
sit secunda [syllaba] product&acirc; mor&acirc; longa'&mdash;<i>KB</i> 68), is even less
likely to be right, since <i>dicere</i> in this context could only mean
'pronounce', as at Cic <i>Or</i> 159 '"inclitus" dicimus breui prima littera,
"insanus" producta'.</p>

<p><b>13. EXIT.</b> <i>Exire</i> similarly used of words being uttered at <i>Her</i> VIII
115-16 (Hermione speaking) 'saepe Neoptolemi pro nomine nomen Orestae /
<i>exit</i>, et errorem uocis ut omen amo'. <i>OLD exeo</i> 2d gives other
instances from Cicero (<i>Brutus</i> 265), Seneca (<i>Ben</i> V 19 4), and
Quintilian (XI iii 33), but from verse outside Ovid only Martial XII xi
3, where the word has a somewhat different meaning: 'cuius Pimpleo lyra
clarior exit ab antro?'.</p>

<p><b>14. PORRECTA</b> is equivalent to <i>longa</i>, and belongs to <i>secunda</i> (<i>sc</i>
syllaba) by hypallage. Compare Quintilian I vi 32 'aut correptis aut
<i>porrectis</i> ... litteris syllabisue' &amp; I vii 14 'usque ad Accium et ultra
<i>porrectas</i> syllabas geminis, ut dixi, uocalibus scripserunt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span> [that is,
they wrote <i>uiita</i> for <i>uita</i> and so on; such spellings occur sometimes
in inscriptions]', and Rutilius Lupus I 3.</p>

<p><b>15. VITIIS.</b> <i>Vitium</i> similarly used for faults of diction at <i>AA</i> III
295-96 'in <i>uitio</i> decor est: quaerunt male reddere uerba; / discunt
posse minus quam potuere loqui', Cic <i>de Or</i> I 116, and Quintilian I v
17, a discussion of the shortening and lengthening of vowels; this he
includes among the 'quae accidunt in dicendo <i>uitia</i>'. Ovid is probably
combining this sense with that of 'poetic weakness', for which compare
<i>Tr</i> I vii 39-40 'quicquid in his igitur <i>uitii</i> rude carmen habebit, /
emendaturus, si licuisset, eram' and the use of <i>uitiosus</i> at xiii 17
and <i>Tr</i> IV i 1 and IV x 61.</p>

<p><b>16. MERITO PECTVS HABERE NEGER.</b> 'People would quite rightly say that I
was ignorant'. Compare <i>Met</i> XIII 290-91 &amp; 295 (Ulysses is speaking of
Ajax's claim to the arms of Achilles) 'artis opus tantae rudis et <i>sine
pectore</i> miles / indueret? neque enim clipei caelamina nouit ... postulat
ut capiat <i>quae non intellegit</i> arma!'.</p>

<p><b>17-18. MVNERIS ... QVOD MEVS ADIECTO FAENORE REDDET AMOR.</b> <i>Adiecto
faenore</i> = 'with interest added on'; Ovid will make up for his past
negligence by sending Tuticanus more than one poem ('tibi <i>carmina</i>
mittam'). It is clear from the opening distich of poem xiv that Ovid
sent the poem to Tuticanus very soon after the composition of xii: 'Haec
tibi mittuntur quem sum <i>modo</i> carmine questus / non aptum numeris nomen
habere meis'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p>A similar use of <i>faenus</i> at <i>EP</i> III i 79-81 'nec ... debetur meritis
gratia nulla meis. / redditur illa quidem grandi cum <i>faenore</i> nobis'.</p>

<p>The variant AGER (<i>TM<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup></i>) for <i>amor</i> was clearly induced by such
passages as Tib II vi 21-22 'spes sulcis credit aratis / semina quae
magno <i>faenore</i> reddat <i>ager</i>', <i>RA</i> 173-74 'obrue uersata Cerealia
semina terra, / quae tibi cum multo <i>faenore</i> reddat <i>ager</i>', and <i>EP</i> I
v 25-26 'at, puto ... sata cum multo <i>faenore</i> reddit <i>ager</i>': these
passages refer to the original meaning of <i>faenus</i> ('faenum appellatur
naturalis terrae fetus; ob quam causam et nummorum fetus <i>faenus</i> est
uocatum'&mdash;Festus 94 Muller, 83 Lindsay).</p>

<p><b>18. REDDET</b> <i>GCMIT</i> REDDIT <i>BFHL</i>. Numerous instances of similar
corruptions in Lucan and Juvenal given by Willis (166-67), who remarks
'The general trend seems to be from other tenses to the present, and
from other persons and numbers to the third person singular'.</p>

<p><b>19. QVACVMQVE NOTA.</b> 'With whatever method of indicating your name is
possible'. For the collocation of <i>nota</i> and <i>nomen</i>, see <i>Aen</i> III
443-44 'insanam uatem aspicies, quae rupe sub ima / fata canit foliisque
<i>notas et nomina</i> mandat'.</p>

<p>Luck joins the phrase with the following <i>tibi carmina mittam</i>, but the
construction seems somewhat cumbersome; it is probably better to retain
the comma after <i>nota</i> and take the phrase with <i>teque canam</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p><p><b>20-22. PVERO ... PVER ... FRATRI FRATER.</b> For Ovid's use of polyptoton,
see at viii 67 <i>uatis ... uates</i> (<a href="#Page_278">p 278</a>).</p>

<p><b>23. DVXQVE COMESQVE.</b> The same phrase at <i>Tr</i> III vii 18 (to his
stepdaughter Perilla) 'utque pater natae <i>duxque comesque</i> fui' and <i>Tr</i>
IV x 119-20 (to his Muse) 'tu <i>dux et comes</i> es, tu nos abducis ab
Histro, / in medioque mihi das Helicone locum'.</p>

<p><b>24. FRENA NOVELLA.</b> For the image, see at ii 23 <i>frena remisi</i> (<a href="#Page_169">p 169</a>).
<i>Nouellus</i> is a rare word in poetry. In prose, the word is often used of
young plants or farm animals; and here <i>frena nouella</i> may well be a
metonymy for <i>frena nouellorum equorum</i>. Alternatively, the word could
be equivalent to <i>noua</i> 'new, unfamiliar', as at <i>Fast</i> III 455 'iamque
indignanti <i>noua frena</i> receperat ore'. In either case, Ovid is clearly
referring to the beginning of his poetic career.</p>

<p><b>25. SAEPE EGO CORREXI SVB TE CENSORE LIBELLOS.</b> Compare <i>Tr</i> III vii
23-24 (to Perilla) 'dum licuit, tua saepe mihi, tibi nostra legebam; /
saepe tui <i>iudex</i>, saepe magister eram'. <i>Censore</i> was probably still
felt as a metaphor; the only precedent given at <i>OLD censor</i> 2b is Hor
<i>Ep</i> II ii 109-10 'at qui legitimum cupiet fecisse poema / cum tabulis
<i>animum censoris</i> sumet <i>honesti</i>', which is virtually a simile.</p>

<p><b>26. SAEPE TIBI ADMONITV FACTA LITVRA MEO EST.</b> Similar phrasing in a
similar context at <i>EP</i> II iv 17-18 (to Atticus) 'utque meus lima rasus
liber esset amici, / <i>non semel admonitu facta litura tuo est</i>'.</p>

<p><b>27. DIGNAM MAEONIIS PHAEACIDA ... CHARTIS.</b> 'A Phaeacid worthy of the
Homeric original you were translating'. It is clear from xvi 27<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span> that
Tuticanus produced a translation rather than a new work in imitation of
Homer: 'et qui Maeoniam Phaeacida <i>uertit</i>'.</p>

<p><b>27. MAEONIIS</b> = 'Homeric', Homer being considered a native of Maeonia
(Lydia). The same use at <i>RA</i> 373 'Maeonio ... pede', <i>EP</i> III iii 31-32
'Maeonio ... carmine', and Prop II xxviii 29 'Maeonias ... heroidas'; the
word in this sense perhaps brought into standard poetic vocabulary by
Horace (<i>Carm</i> I vi 2 'Maeonii carminis', <i>Carm</i> IV ix 5-6 'Maeonius
... Homerus').</p>

<p><b>27. CHARTIS</b> = <i>carminibus</i>. Compare <i>AA</i> II 746 'uos eritis <i>chartae</i>
proxima cura meae'. The metonymy is not found in Virgil or Propertius,
but compare Lucretius IV 970 'patriis ... <i>chartis</i>' = 'Latinis uersibus'
(I 137) and Hor <i>Carm</i> IV ix 30-31 'non ego te meis / <i>chartis</i>
inornatum silebo' (where Kiessling-Heinze point out that <i>chartis</i>
refers to the poem in its published state being transmitted to others,
rather than to the poem at its moment of composition).</p>

<p><b>28. CVM TE PIERIAE PERDOCVERE DEAE.</b> For the poet's being divinely
taught, compare Prop II x 10 &amp; IV i 133, <i>Her</i> XV 27-28 'at mihi
Pegasides blandissima carmina dictant; / iam canitur toto nomen in orbe
meum', and the disclaimers at Prop II i 3 and <i>AA</i> I 25-28 'non ego,
Phoebe, datas a te mihi mentiar artes, / nec nos aeriae uoce monemur
auis, / nec mihi sunt uisae Clio Cliusque sorores / seruanti pecudes
uallibus, Ascra, tuis'. The topic is an important one in ancient
literature, the most influential passages being the opening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span> of Hesiod's
<i>Theogony</i> (referred to in the passage just cited) and the beginning of
Callimachus' <i>Aetia</i>.</p>

<p><b>29. TENOR.</b> 'Course'; the same use at <i>Her</i> VII 111-12 (Dido speaking)
'durat in extremum uitaeque nouissima nostrae / prosequitur fati qui
fuit ante <i>tenor</i>'.</p>

<p><b>29. VIRIDI ... IVVENTA.</b> Ovid is perhaps imitating <i>Aen</i> V 295 'Euryalus
forma insignis <i>uiridique iuuenta</i>'. Similar phrasing at <i>AA</i> III 557
'uiridemque iuuentam', <i>Tr</i> IV x 17 'frater ad eloquium <i>uiridi</i>
tendebat ab aeuo', and <i>Tr</i> III i 7-8 'id quoque quod <i>uiridi</i> quondam
male lusit in aeuo / heu nimium sero damnat et odit opus'; at the last
passage Luck aptly cites <i>Met</i> XV 201-3 'nam tener et lactens puerique
simillimus aeuo / uere nouo [<i>sc</i> annus] est; tunc <i>herba nitens</i> et
roboris expers turget'.</p>

<p><b>30. ALBENTES ... COMAS.</b> For the synecdoche compare Callimachus <i>Ep</i> LXIV
(=<i>Anth Pal</i> V xxiii) 5-6 '&#7969; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#8052; &#948;&#8050; / &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#943;&#954;' &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#957;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#940; &#963;&#949; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#954;&#972;&#956;&#951;'.</p>

<p>Ovid would have been about sixty years of age at the time of this poem,
old by Roman standards; but his father lived to ninety, and was survived
by his wife (<i>Tr</i> IV x 77-80).</p>

<p><b>30. INLABEFACTA</b> occurs in classical Latin only here and at viii 9-10
'ius aliquod faciunt adfinia uincula nobis / (quae semper maneant
<i>inlabefacta</i> precor)'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>

<p><b>31-32. QVAE NISI TE MOVEANT, DVRO TIBI PECTORA FERRO / ESSE VEL INVICTO

<i>adamantaque</i> teque', <i>Her</i> X 109-10, and <i>Met</i> IX 614-15 (Byblis on her
brother) 'nec rigidas silices solidumue in pectore <i>ferrum</i> / aut
<i>adamanta</i> gerit'.</p>

<p>Professor R. J. Tarrant notes the unexpected shift in the thought of the
poem: earlier it was Ovid who was guilty of delaying in sending
Tuticanus any sign of his friendship. Ovid might be postponing the real
point of the letter for reasons of tact: Tuticanus has acted as though
his long association with Ovid meant nothing to him, but Ovid does not
want to complain of this openly, and so stresses his own failure to send
Tuticanus a letter.</p>

<p><b>33-36.</b> The set of <i>adynata</i> is remarkable for the way Ovid makes each of
them relate to his own hardships; even Boreas and Notus have a specific
connection, since Ovid complains so often of the climate of Tomis.</p>

<p><b>35. TEPIDVS BOREAS ... SIT.</b> A comparable inversion of nature described at
<i>Ibis</i> 34 'et tepidus gelido flabit ab axe Notus' (before Ovid will
forgive his enemy).</p>

<p><b>35. PRAEFRIGIDVS</b> appears here for the first time in Latin; it occurs
later in Celsus and the elder Pliny. <i>Praegelidus</i>, however, is found at
Livy XXI 54 7.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>

<p><b>36. ET POSSIT FATVM MOLLIVS ESSE MEVM.</b> The personal reference in the
last element of the series of <i>adynata</i> is a clear break with the
conventions of the topic. The last (and therefore greatest) curse in the
<i>Ibis</i> has a similar personal reference: 'denique Sarmaticas inter
Geticasque sagittas / his precor ut uiuas et moriare locis'.</p>

<p><b>37. LAPSO</b> <i>FHILT</i> LASSO <i>BCM</i>. <i>Lapso ... sodali</i> seems to me the
preferable reading, since it contrasts Ovid's former life in Rome with
his disgrace and exile; but <i>lasso</i> is well attested and can be
construed easily enough. Unfortunately, parallels from the poems of
exile are of little use, since in most of them the one word could easily
be read for the other: 'tu quoque magnorum laudes admitte uirorum, / ut
facis, et lapso [<i>uar</i> lasso] quam potes adfer opem' (<i>EP</i> II iii
47-48), 'fac modo permaneas lasso [<i>uar</i> lapso], Graecine, fidelis, /
duret et in longas impetus iste moras' (<i>EP</i> II vi 35-36), 'regia, crede
mihi, res est succurrere lapsis [<i>uar</i> lassis], / conuenit et tanto,
quantus es ipse, uiro' (<i>EP</i> II ix 11-12), 'digne uir hac serie, lapso
[<i>uar</i> lasso] succurrere amico / conueniens istis moribus esse puta'
(<i>EP</i> III ii 109). Professor R. J. Tarrant cites similar variants in the
text of Seneca at <i>HF</i> 646 &amp; 803 and <i>Thy</i> 616 &amp; 658.</p>

<p>A clear decision can be made, however, for the phrase <i>res lassae</i>; it
is certified as the correct term by the parallel phrase <i>res fessae</i>,
for which see <i>Aen</i> III 145 'quam <i>fessis</i> finem <i>rebus</i> ferat' and
<i>Aen</i> XI 335 'consulite in medium et <i>rebus</i> succurrite <i>fessis</i>', cited
by Luck at <i>Tr</i> I v 35. For <i>res lassae</i> in Ovid, compare <i>Tr</i> I v 35
'quo magis,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span> o pauci, <i>rebus</i> succurrite <i>lassis</i>', <i>Tr</i> V ii 41 'unde
petam <i>lassis</i> solacia <i>rebus</i>?', <i>EP</i> II ii 47 'nunc tua pro <i>lassis</i>
nitatur gratia <i>rebus'</i>, and <i>EP</i> II iii 93 'respicis antiquum <i>lassis</i>
in <i>rebus</i> amicum'; in each of these passages <i>lapsis</i> is found as a
variant for <i>lassis</i>. Similarly, the sixth-century <i>codex Romanus</i> reads
<i>lapsis</i> at Virgil <i>G</i> IV 449 'uenimus hinc <i>lassis</i> quaesitum oracula
rebus'.</p>

<p><b>38. HIC CVMVLVS NOSTRIS ABSIT ABESTQVE MALIS.</b> Festus defines <i>cumulus</i>
as a heap added to an already full measure (s.u. <i>auctarium</i>, 14 Muller,
14 Lindsay). The transferred sense is common in Cicero (<i>Prou Cons</i> 26,
<i>S Rosc</i> 8, <i>Att</i> XVI iii 3), and is found elsewhere in Ovid at <i>EP</i> II
v 35-36 'hoc tibi facturo uel si non ipse rogarem / accedat cumulus
gratia nostra leuis' and <i>Met</i> XI 205-6 'stabat opus: pretium rex
infitiatur et addit, / perfidiae <i>cumulum</i>, falsis periuria uerbis'.</p>

<p><b>38. ABSIT ABESTQVE.</b> The more natural <i>abest absitque</i> cannot be placed
in a pentameter.</p>

<p><b>39. PER SVPEROS, QVORVM CERTISSIMVS ILLE EST.</b> Similar line-endings at
<i>Ibis</i> 23-24 'di melius! <i>quorum longe mihi maximus ille est</i>, / qui
nostras inopes noluit esse uias' and <i>EP</i> I ii 97-98 'di faciant igitur,
<i>quorum iustissimus ipse est</i>, / alma nihil maius Caesare terra ferat'.</p>

<p><b>40. QVO ... PRINCIPE.</b> Professor R. J. Tarrant points out that Augustus
must here be meant, since it appears from 20 that Ovid and Tuticanus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
were contemporaries: Tuticanus must by the time of the poem's writing
have been in later middle age, rather late to be prospering only under
Tiberius. T. P. Wiseman (268) has suggested that Ovid's Tuticanus might
be the son of a Tuticanus Callus known to have been senator before 48
BC.</p>

<p><b>41-42. EFFICE ... NE SPERATA MEAM DESERAT AVRA RATEM.</b> 'See to it that the
breeze I hope for does not fail to come to my ship'. <i>Deserere</i>
generally refers to something failing one that was originally operative:
compare Cic <i>Att</i> VII vii 7 'nisi me lucerna desereret' ('if the lamp
were not going out'&mdash;Shackleton Bailey), Plautus <i>Mer</i> 123 'genua hunc
cursorem deserunt' and the other passages cited at <i>OLD desero</i> 2b. But
<i>sperata</i> indicates that the breeze cannot yet be present; other
instances of the same metaphor at viii 27-28 'quamlibet exigua si nos ea
<i>iuuerit</i> aura, / obruta de mediis cumba resurget aquis', ix 73 'et si
quae <i>dabit</i> aura sinum, laxate rudentes', and <i>Tr</i> IV v 19-20 'utque
facis, remis ad opem luctare ferendam, / <i>dum ueniat</i> placido mollior
aura deo',</p>

<p><b>43. QVID MANDEM QVAERIS.</b> Similar wording at <i>EP</i> III i 33-34 (to his
wife) '<i>quid facias quaeris?</i> quaeras hoc scilicet ipsa [<i>Riese</i>: ipsum
<i>codd</i>]: / inuenies, uere si reperire uoles'.</p>

<p>Ovid's pretense of not knowing what to tell Tuticanus to do was an
ingenious solution to his friends' complaint that he was constantly
repeating the same instructions to them (<i>EP</i> III vii 1-6). Professor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
R. J. Tarrant points out the balance with the poem's start, where Ovid
pretends not to know how to address Tuticanus.</p>

<p><b>43. PEREAM NISI DICERE VIX EST.</b> Similar doubt expressed at <i>Tr</i> IV iii
31-32 'quid tamen ipse precer dubito, nec dicere possum / affectum quem
te mentis habere uelim'. <i>Peream nisi</i>, which Ovid plays on in the next
line, is colloquial and foreign to poetic diction: instances at <i>OLD
pereo</i> 3b.</p>

<p><b>44. SI MODO QVI PERIIT ILLE PERIRE POTEST.</b> Similar phrasing at <i>Tr</i> I iv
27-28 'uos animam saeuae fessam subducite morti, / <i>si modo qui periit
non periisse potest</i>'.</p>

<p><b>45. NEC QVID NOLIMVE VELIMVE.</b> Compare <i>Met</i> XI 492-93 '<i>nec</i> se
... fatetur / scire ratis [<i>codd</i>: satis <i>fort scribendum</i>] rector
... <i>quid iubeatue uetetue</i>' and <i>Tr</i> I ii 31-32 'rector in incerto est
<i>nec quid fugiatue petatue</i> / inuenit'.</p>

<p><b>46. NEC SATIS VTILITAS EST MIHI NOTA MEA.</b> 'And I am at a loss to know
what is to my advantage'. <i>Satis</i> strengthens the sentence: compare Ter
<i>Hec</i> 877 'ego istuc sati' scio', 'I know that very well'. For
<i>utilitas</i>, see at ix 48 <i>publica ... utilitas</i> (<a href="#Page_300">p 300</a>).</p>

<p><b>48. SENSVS</b> here means 'judgement' or 'good sense', as at Prop II xii 3
'is primum uidit sine <i>sensu</i> uiuere amantes' and Val Max I vi ext 1 'si
quod uestigium in uecordi pectore <i>sensus</i> fuisset'. Elsewhere in Ovid
<i>sensus</i> carries the meaning 'awareness, consciousness'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p><b>48. CVM RE</b> <i>codd</i> CVM SPE <i>Heinsius</i>. <i>Cum re</i>, 'along with my fortune',
seems somewhat out of place; but Burman pointed out that <i>consilium et
res</i> seems to have been a Latin phrase, citing Sallust <i>Iug</i> 74 'neque
illi <i>res neque consilium</i> aut quisquam hominum satis placebat' and Ter
<i>Eun</i> 240-41 'itan parasti te ut spes nulla relicua in te siet tibi? /
simul <i>consilium cum re</i> amisti?'.</p>

<p><b>50. QVAQVE VIA VENIAS AD MEA VOTA, VIDE.</b> This is a provisional
restoration of the line. The manuscript reading which most closely
approaches this text is that of <i>L</i> and <i>F<sup>3</sup></i>, QVAQVE VIAM FACIAS AD MEA
VOTA, VIDE; the other manuscripts have the same text, except that QVOQVE
is found in some for <i>quaque</i>, while for <i>uide</i> there are the variants
MODO, VADO, and VALE.</p>

<p>My restoration is based on 6 '<i>quaque</i> meos <i>adeas</i> est <i>uia</i> nulla
modos' and <i>Fast</i> I 431-32 (Priapus approaches the sleeping nymph Lotis)
'a pedibus tracto uelamine <i>uota</i> / <i>ad sua felici coeperat ire uia</i>'.</p>

<p>Before Professor E. Fantham brought this passage to my attention, I had
thought that <i>M</i>'s <i>quoque uiam facias ad mea uota modo</i> was correct.
<i>Modo</i> is weak and does not fit well with the preceding <i>qua ... parte</i>,
but at least is acceptable Latin; for <i>quo ... modo</i> compare <i>Med</i> 1-2
'Discite quae faciem commendet cura, puellae, / et <i>quo</i> sit uobis forma
tuenda <i>modo</i>' and <i>Ibis</i> 55-56 'nunc <i>quo</i> Battiades inimicum deuouet
Ibin, / <i>hoc</i> ego deuoueo teque tuosque <i>modo</i>'.</p>

<p>The image in <i>quoque ... uado</i> ['ford'] is rather strange, and for this
sense of the word Ovid seems to have used the plural (<i>Met</i> III 19;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
<i>Met</i> IX 108). At <i>Fast</i> IV 300 'sedit limoso pressa carina <i>uado</i>',
<i>uado</i> means 'river-bottom'.</p>

<p>Ovid does not end any one of his dozens of verse epistles with <i>uale</i>,
so the reading of <i>FTI<sup>2ul</sup></i> must be discounted.</p>

<p>If my restoration is correct or nearly correct, the original corruptions
would have been of <i>uia</i> to <i>uiam</i> and of <i>uenias</i> to <i>facias</i>; the
latter corruption might have been a deliberate interpolation to procure
a governing verb for <i>uiam</i>, or might have been a misreading of or
conjectural restoration for a damaged archetype. The variant <i>quoque</i>
for <i>quaque</i> and the different variants for <i>uide</i> would have been
secondary corruptions, unless they also were the result of a damaged
archetype.</p>

<p><b>50. VIDE.</b> For <i>uide</i> at the end of the pentameter, compare <i>EP</i> II ii
55-56 'num tamen excuses erroris origine factum, / an nihil expediat
tale mouere, uide'. It must however be said that <i>uide</i> is somewhat
strange following the subjunctive <i>quaeras</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XIII_To_Carus" id="XIII_To_Carus"></a>XIII. To Carus</h2>


<p>Nothing is known of the Carus to whom this poem is addressed beyond what
Ovid tells us: that he wrote a poem on Hercules (11-12; xvi 7-8) and
that he was teacher of the sons of Germanicus (47-48).</p>

<p>The poem begins with a pun on the meaning of Carus' name (1-2). This
opening will in itself demonstrate to Carus who his correspondent is
(3-6). Carus can himself be recognized through his style (7-12). Ovid
does not claim that his poetry is excellent, only that it is individual;
if his poetry is poor, it is because he is almost a Getic poet now
(13-18). He has written a poem in Getic, which was well received
(19-22). It was a description of the apotheosis of Augustus and a
laudation of the members of the imperial family (23-32). When he
finished reciting the poem, he was applauded; one person even suggested
that his piety merited a recall (33-38). But it is now the sixth year of
his exile, and poems will not assist him, since in the past they have
done him harm. Carus should use his influence to secure Ovid's recall
(39-50).</p>

<p>Certain elements of the poem, such as the flattering references to
Carus' poetry and the request for his help, are commonplaces of the
poetry of exile; the list of the members of the imperial family is
similarly paralleled in Ovid's other poems (see at 25-32 [p 400]). Ovid
nowhere else explicitly describes any of his Getic poems.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<p><b>1. MEMORANDE</b> <i>BMFHILT</i> NVMERANDE <i>C</i>. For <i>memorande</i> compare <i>Tr</i> I v 1
'O mihi post nullos umquam <i>memorande</i> sodales'. <i>Numerande</i> is in
itself acceptable enough: see ix 35 'hic ego praesentes inter
<i>numerarer</i> amicos'.</p>

<p><b>2. QVI QVOD ES, ID</b> <i>BCFI</i> QVI QVOD ID ES <i>MH</i> QVIQVE QVOD ES <i>LT</i>. For
the use of <i>id</i>, Ehwald (<i>KB</i> 47) cited <i>Fast</i> II 23-24 'quaeque capit
lictor domibus purgamina uersis ['swept out'] / torrida cum mica farra,
uocantur <i>idem</i> [<i>sc</i> februa]', Hor <i>Sat</i> II iii 139-41 (of Orestes)
'non Pyladen ferro uiolare aususue sororem / Electram, tantum male dicit
utrique uocando / hanc Furiam, hunc <i>aliud</i>', Sen <i>Ben</i> I 3 10 'id
quemque uocari iubent', and Tac <i>Germ</i> 6 'definitur et numerus: centeni
ex singulis pagis sunt, <i>id</i>que ipsum inter suos uocantur' ['they are
called "The Hundred"']'.</p>

<p><i>Quique quod es</i> is, however, an attractive reading: compare <i>Tr</i> I v
1-2 'O mihi post nullos umquam memorande sodales, / <i>et cui</i> praecipue
sors mea uisa sua est'. <i>Quique quod</i> is obviously prone to haplography;
on the other hand, it could be a rewriting of <i>qui quod id es</i>, which is
itself presumably a simple corruption through interchange of <i>qui quod
es id</i>. I therefore print <i>qui quod es id</i>, although with some
hesitation.</p>

<p><b>2. VERE.</b> 'Justly'. For the same adverb used once again of names
"properly" applied, see <i>Tr</i> V x 13-14 'quem tenet Euxini mendax
cognomine litus, / et Scythici <i>uere</i> terra <i>sinistra</i> freti'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<p><b>2. CARE.</b> Luck among others believes that Carus is also addressed at <i>Tr</i>
III v 17-18 'sum quoque, <i>care</i>, tuis defensus uiribus absens / (scis
"carum" ueri nominis esse loco)'; but it seems excessively ingenious to
make Ovid say 'I call you <i>carus</i> instead of your real name, Carus'.
Still, as Professor R. J. Tarrant points out to me, the passage is odd,
in that Ovid elsewhere uses <i>care</i> only in conjunction with another
vocative (compare viii 89 '<i>care</i> Suilli' and <i>Tr</i> III iv 1-2 '<i>care</i>
quidem ... sed tempore duro / cognite'); <i>care</i> may have been used as a
metrical equivalent to the suppressed name, in the way the "cover names"
in elegy correspond to the shape of the alleged actual names of the
women. Unlike <i>care</i>, <i>carissime</i> is often found by itself (<i>Tr</i> I v 3,
III iii 27, III vi 1, IV vii 19 &amp; V vii 5; <i>EP</i> II iv 21 &amp; IV x 3).</p>

<p><b>2. AVE</b> occurs in Ovid only here and at <i>RA</i> 639-40 'nec ueniat seruus,
nec flens ancillula fictum / suppliciter dominae nomine dicat "aue!"',
and is not common in writing. It was, however, frequent in everyday
speech, as is clear from Sen <i>Ben</i> VI 34 3 'uulgare et publicum uerbum
et promiscuum ignotis "aue"'.</p>

<p><b>3. SALVTERIS</b> <i>MFT</i> SALVTARIS <i>BCHIL</i>. Ovid usually employs the
subjunctive in indirect questions; this is demonstrated by metre at such
passages as <i>Fast</i> VI 385-86 'increpat illos / Iuppiter et sacro quid
<i>uelit</i> ore docet', <i>Tr</i> II 294 '<i>sustulerit</i> quare quaeret
Ericthonium', <i>Tr</i> II 297-98 'Isidis aede sedens cur hanc Saturnia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
quaeret / <i>egerit</i> Ionio Bosphorioque mari', <i>Tr</i> V xiv 1-2 'Quanta tibi
<i>dederim</i> nostris monumenta libellis ... uides', <i>EP</i> I i 55-56 'talia
caelestes fieri praeconia gaudent, / ut sua quid <i>ualeant</i> numina teste
probent' and <i>EP</i> II vii 3 'subsequitur quid <i>agas</i> audire uoluntas'.</p>

<p>I have found two passages where metre demonstrates that Ovid used the
indicative in an indirect question, <i>Met</i> X 637 'quid <i>facit</i> [<i>codd
plerique</i>: quod facit <i>recc</i> quidque agat <i>Heinsius</i> quid factum
<i>Merkel</i> quid uelit <i>Nick</i> quid facti <i>Rappold</i> dissidet <i>Korn</i> quid
sciat <i>Slater</i>] ignorans amat et non sentit amorem' and <i>EP</i> I viii
25-26 'sed memor unde <i>abii</i> queror, o iucunde sodalis, / accedant
nostris saeua quod arma malis'. But in the first passage <i>faciat</i> would
have an ambiguous meaning, since it could represent either <i>quid facio</i>
or <i>quid faciam</i>, and in the second <i>&#259;b&#301;&#277;rim</i>
with its short 'a', 'i', and 'e',
would be metrically intractable.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say whether the scribes were more prone to influence
by the subjunctive normal in classical Latin prose, or by the indicative
of the Romance languages and of ecclesiastical Latin. I print the
subjunctive in view of Ovid's usual practice, and in particular because
of <i>EP</i> I ii 5 'forsitan haec a quo <i>mittatur</i> epistula quaeras' and
<i>EP</i> III v 1 'Quam legis unde tibi <i>mittatur</i> epistula quaeris?'. But
Professor R. J. Tarrant notes that the need for a dependent subjunctive
would be more strongly felt with <i>quaerere</i> in these two passages than
with the <i>index</i> of the present passage.</p>

<p>Not all poets were as strict as Ovid in using the subjunctive in
indirect questions. Propertius at III v 26-46 has the following verbs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
in a series of indirect questions: <i>temperet</i>, <i>uenit</i>, <i>deficit</i>,
<i>redit</i>, <i>superant</i>, <i>captet</i>, <i>sit uentura</i>, <i>bibit</i>, <i>tremuere</i>,
<i>luxerit</i> (from <i>lugere</i>), <i>coit</i>, <i>exeat</i>, <i>eat</i>, <i>sint</i> (uar <i>sunt</i>),
<i>furit</i>, <i>custodit</i>, <i>descendit</i>, <i>potest</i>.</p>

<p><b>3. COLOR HIC.</b> 'The style of this opening'. Ovid is presumably referring
to its playful tone. Compare <i>Tr</i> I i 61 (to his poem) 'ut titulo
careas, ipso noscere <i>colore</i>', at which Luck cites Martial XII ii 17-18
'quid titulum poscis? uersus duo tresue legantur, / clamabunt omnes te,
liber, esse meum'.</p>

<p><i>Color</i> is not found in precisely this sense until Horace. For a
discussion of its development, see Brink at Hor <i>AP</i> 86 <i>operumque
colores</i>.</p>

<p><b>4. STRVCTVRA.</b> This passage is the first instance cited by <i>OLD</i>
<i>structura</i> 1b of <i>structura</i> in this transferred sense, which becomes
common in Silver prose, particularly Quintilian (I x 23, VIII vi 67, IX
iv 45). Lewis and Short point out that Cicero uses the word in similar
contexts only as a simile: compare <i>Brut</i> 33 'ante hunc [<i>sc</i> Isocratem]
enim uerborum <i>quasi structura</i> et quaedam ad numerum conclusio nulla
erat', <i>Or</i> 149 '<i>quasi structura quaedam</i>', and <i>Opt Gen</i> 5 'et
uerborum est <i>structura quaedam'</i>.</p>

<p>There are two instances in Ovid of <i>struere</i> with a similar meaning,
both from the <i>Ex Ponto</i>. One is from line 20 of this poem ('<i>structa</i>
... uerba'), while the other is at II v 19 '<i>structos</i> inter fera proelia
uersus'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>

<p><b>5. MIRIFICA</b> is a colloquialism. Common in the letters of Cicero, the
word (according to <i>TLL</i> VIII 1060 52) is not found in Livy, Vitruvius,
Celsus, Curtius, or Tacitus. The only poets apart from Terence and Ovid
cited as using the word are Accius, Ausonius, and the author of the
<i>Ciris</i> (although the passage where the word occurs, 12-13, is corrupt);
see also Catullus LIII 2, LXXI 4, and LXXXIV 3. For a discussion of
<i>mirificus</i>, see Axelson 61, and of the similarly colloquial <i>mirifice</i>
Hofmann 78.</p>

<p><b>5. PVBLICA</b> = 'usual, ordinary'. Compare <i>Am</i> III vii 11-12 'et mihi
blanditias dixit dominumque uocauit, / et quae praeterea <i>publica</i> uerba
iuuant', <i>AA</i> III 479-80 'munda, sed e medio consuetaque uerba, puellae,
/ scribite: sermonis <i>publica</i> forma placet', and Sen <i>Ben</i> VI 34 3
(quoted at 2 <i>aue</i>).</p>

<p><b>6. QVALIS ENIM CVMQVE EST.</b> A common phrase in the poets when they speak
of their own verse: compare Catullus I 8-9 'quare habe tibi quidquid hoc
libelli / <i>qualecumque</i>', Hor <i>Sat</i> I x 88-89 'quibus [<i>sc</i> amicis]
haec, sunt <i>qualiacumque</i>, / arridere uelim, doliturus, si placent spe /
deterius nostra' (at which Bentley cited the present passage), Martial V
lx 5 '<i>qualiscumque</i> legaris ut per orbem', and Statius <i>Sil</i> II praef
'haec <i>qualiacumque</i> sunt, Melior carissime, si tibi non displicuerint,
a te publicum accipiant; sin minus, ad me reuertantur' (both passages
cited by Munro, <i>Criticisms</i> 5).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>

<p><b>7. VT TITVLVM CHARTAE DE FRONTE REVELLAS.</b> The same hypothetical case at
<i>Tr</i> I i 61-62 '<i>ut titulo careas</i>, ipso noscere <i>colore</i>; / dissimulare
uelis, te liquet esse meum' and <i>EP</i> II ix 49-52 (to King Cotys) 'nec
regum quisquam magis est instructus ab illis [<i>sc</i> the liberal arts]
... carmina testantur, quae <i>si tua nomina demas</i> / Threicium iuuenem
composuisse negem'.</p>

<p><b>7. CHARTAE.</b> See at xii 27 <i>chartis</i> (<a href="#Page_380">p 380</a>).</p>

<p><b>7. REVELLAS</b> 'tear away' is surprisingly strong in its overtones. It is
found only here in the poems of exile, six times in the other elegies,
and fifteen times in the <i>Metamorphoses</i>.</p>

<p><b>8. QVOD SIT OPVS VIDEOR DICERE POSSE TVVM.</b> 'I think I could say which
work was yours'. Heinsius' QVID SIT OPVS VIDEAR is a strange error: the
interrogative adjective is acceptable enough, while the notion of the
subjunctive must of course be contained in <i>posse</i>, not in the verb that
governs it.</p>

<p><b>11. PRODENT AVCTOREM VIRES.</b> 'His strength will reveal the poet's
identity'. The same sense of <i>prodere</i> at <i>Met</i> II 433 'impedit amplexu
nec se sine crimine <i>prodit</i>', <i>Met</i> XIV 740-41 'adapertaque ianua
factum / prodidit', and <i>Am</i> I viii 109 'uox erat in cursu, cum me mea
<i>prodidit</i> umbra'. <i>Vires</i> again used of poetic skill at <i>Tr</i> I vi 29
'ei mihi non magnas quod habent mea carmina <i>uires</i>', <i>Tr</i> IV ix 16
'Pierides <i>uires</i> et sua tela dabunt', <i>EP</i> III iii 34, and <i>EP</i> III iv
79.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p><b>13. DEPRENSA.</b> <i>Deprendere</i> 'recognize, detect' is also found at <i>Met</i> II
93-94 'utinamque oculos in pectore posses / inserere et patrias intus
<i>deprendere</i> curas' and <i>Met</i> VII 536-37 'strage canum primo uolucrumque
ouiumque boumque / inque feris subiti <i>deprensa</i> potentia morbi', as
well as at Livy XLII 17 7 (<i>uenenum</i>) and Celsus III 18 3 '[phrenetici
...] summam ... speciem sanitatis in captandis malorum operum
occasionibus praebent, sed exitu <i>deprenduntur</i>'. This seems to be a
semi-medical sense; Professor R. J. Tarrant suggests that <i>colore</i> may

<p>For the modern reader, Thersites' ugliness is hardly his leading
characteristic; but at <i>EP</i> III ix 9-10 Ovid again refers to his
appearance: 'auctor opus laudat: sic forsitan Agrius [his father] olim /
Thersiten facie dixerit esse bona'. Other mentions of Thersites'
ugliness at Lucian <i>Dial Mort</i> XXV (Thersites argues that he is now as
handsome as Nireus) and Epictetus <i>Diss</i> II 23 32 (Thersites is
contrasted with Achilles), to which Professor C. P. Jones adds from
Greek epigram <i>Greek Inscr. Brit. Mus.</i> IV ii 1114; other citations from

This is the only mention of Nireus in
the poem; but Demetrius (<i>Peri Hermeneias</i> 62; cited by Cope at
Aristotle <i>Rhet</i> 1414a) remarks that because of Homer's use of
epanaphora (the repetition of Nireus' name) and dialysis (asyndeton)

Ovid
mentions Nireus again at <i>AA</i> II 109-12 'sis licet antiquo Nireus
adamatus Homero ... ingenii dotes corporis adde bonis'; see also Hor
<i>Epod</i> XV 22 'forma ... uincas Nirea', Hor <i>Carm</i> III xx 15 (where Nireus
is paired with Ganymede) and Prop III xviii 27 'Nirea non facies, non
uis exemit Achillem'; from Greek epigram Professor C. P. Jones cites
Peek <i>Griech. Versinschr.</i> 1728 (Merkelbach <i>ZPE</i> 25 [1977] 281).</p>

<p><b>16. CONSPICIENDVS.</b> The word is metrically suited to the second half of
the pentameter, before the disyllable: compare Tib I ii 70 &amp; II iii 52,
<i>Fast</i> V 118 &amp; V 170, and <i>Tr</i> II 114.</p>

<p><b>17. MIRARI SI</b> is a colloquialism: most of the passages from verse cited
at <i>TLL</i> VIII 1067 14 are from Plautus and the hexameter poems of
Horace; from Propertius compare II iii 33 'haec ego nunc <i>mirer si</i>
flagret nostra iuuentus?' and from Ovid <i>Her</i> X 105 'non equidem <i>miror
si</i> stat uictoria tecum' and <i>Tr</i> I ix 21 'saeua neque <i>admiror</i> metuunt
<i>si</i> fulmina'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<p><b>19. A PVDET, ET GETICO SCRIPSI SERMONE LIBELLVM.</b> The rest of the distich
after <i>a pudet</i> explains the exclamation ('I have even written ...'),
and so the punctuation should mark the break. The idiom is different
from the <i>et pudet et</i> construction seen at xv 29 'et pudet et metuo ['I
am both embarrassed and afraid'] semperque eademque precari' and <i>Tr</i> V
vii 57-58 'et pudet et fateor ['I confess with embarrassment'], iam
desuetudine longa / uix subeunt ipsi uerba Latina mihi'.</p>

<p>The only other instance of independent <i>a pudet</i> in Ovid is <i>AA</i> III
803-4 'quid iuuet et uoces et anhelitus arguat oris; / a pudet, arcanas
pars habet ista notas', which, however, Professor R. J. Tarrant suspects
is part of an interpolation.</p>

<p><b>19. GETICO ... SERMONE.</b> Ovid repeatedly claims to have learned Getic and
Sarmatian: compare <i>Tr</i> III xiv 47-48 'Threicio Scythicoque fere
circumsonor ore, / et uideor Geticis scribere posse modis', <i>Tr</i> V vii
55-56 'ille ego Romanus uates&mdash;ignoscite, Musae!&mdash; / Sarmatico cogor
plurima more loqui', <i>Tr</i> V xii 58 'nam didici Getice Sarmaticeque
loqui', and <i>EP</i> III ii 40 (identical to <i>Tr</i> V xii 58).</p>

<p>It is of course not possible to prove that Ovid did or did not learn
Getic and write poetry in that language. But in the absence of other
evidence, it seems better to suppose that he did learn the language
since (a) he claims to have do so, (b) Latin and Greek would hardly have
been widely spoken in the region, and (c) a man with Ovid's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span> linguistic
facility would have had little difficulty in learning the languages of
the region.</p>

<p><b>20. STRVCTAQVE ... VERBA.</b> Compare Cic <i>de Or</i> III 171 'struere uerba',
and see at 4 <i>structura</i> (<a href="#Page_393">p 393</a>).</p>

<p><b>20. NOSTRIS ... MODIS.</b> Ovid did not use native rhythms, but instead used
Latin metres.</p>

<p><b>21. ET PLACVI.</b> Luck compares <i>EP</i> I v 63-64 'forsitan audacter faciam,
sed glorior Histrum / ingenio nullum maius habere meo', but it is clear
enough from the context that Ovid was there speaking of his Latin
poetry.</p>

<p><b>21. GRATARE.</b> <i>Gratari</i> is extremely rare in Latin, being found only in
the poets and historians; <i>gr&#257;t&#365;l&#257;ri</i> was of course not
available (except for <i>gr&#257;t&#365;l&#335;r</i>) for use in dactylic verse.
Other instances of the word in Ovid at ix 13 <i>'gratatusque</i> darem cum
dulcibus oscula uerbis', <i>Her</i> VI 119 'nunc etiam peperi; <i>gratare</i>
ambobus, Iason!', <i>Her</i> XI 65, <i>Met</i> I 578, VI 434, IX 244 &amp; 312, and
<i>Fast</i> III 418.</p>

<p><b>22. INTER INHVMANOS ... GETAS.</b> The same phrase in the same metrical
position at <i>EP</i> I v 65-66 'hoc ubi uiuendum est satis est si consequor
aruo / <i>inter inhumanos</i> esse poeta <i>Getas</i>' and <i>EP</i> III v 27-28 <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>'quem
... fatum ... <i>inter inhumanos</i> maluit esse <i>Getas</i>'.</p>

<p><b>23. LAVDES DE CAESARE DIXI.</b> In 1896 J. Gilbert ingeniously proposed the
punctuation 'laudes [potential subjunctive]: de Caesare dixi'. But <i>laus
de</i> + ablative instead of the more usual objective genitive construction
is supported by Tac <i>Ann</i> I 12 'addidit laudem de Augusto'. Nipperdey
there explains <i>de</i> by equating <i>laus</i> with <i>oratio</i> and <i>sermo</i>, both
of which take <i>de</i> as a normal construction; but it appears from the
present passage that <i>laus de</i> may have been a special term for
panegyric. Professor E. Fantham notes that Ovid may have been seeking a
synonym for <i>laud&#257;t&#301;&#333;</i>.</p>

<p><b>24. ADIVTA EST NOVITAS NVMINE NOSTRA DEI.</b> <i>Nouitas nostra</i> could mean
either 'my novel attempt' (Wheeler, Lewis and Short) or 'my
inexperience'; if the latter, <i>adiuta</i> would bear the uncommon but quite
valid meaning 'compensated for'; <i>OLD adiuuo</i> 7 cites passages from
Cicero (<i>Fam</i> V xiii 5 'ea quibus secundae res ornantur, aduersae
adiuuantur'), Livy, and Ulpian.</p>

<p><b>25-32.</b> Similar catalogues of the imperial family occur at <i>Met</i> XV
834-47, <i>Tr</i> II 161-68, <i>Tr</i> IV ii 7-12, <i>EP</i> II ii 69-74, and <i>EP</i> II
viii 29-34; these passages are quoted from below.</p>

<p><b>25-26. NAM PATRIS AVGVSTI DOCVI MORTALE FVISSE / CORPUS, IN AETHERIAS
NVMEN ABISSE DOMOS.</b> Other mentions of the deified Augustus at vi 15-16
'coeperat Augustus detectae ignoscere culpae; / spem nostram terras
deseruitque simul' and viii 63-64 'et modo, Caesar, auum, quem uirtus
addidit astris, / sacrarunt aliqua carmina parte tuum'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span> Ovid had
predicted Augustus' apotheosis: see <i>Met</i> XV 838-39 'nec nisi cum senior
Pylios aequauerit annos, / aetherias sedes cognataque sidera tanget',
<i>Tr</i> II 57-58 'optaui peteres caelestia sidera tarde, / parsque fui
turbae parua precantis idem', and <i>Tr</i> V ii 51-52, V v 61-62, V viii
29-30 &amp; V xi 25-26.</p>

<p>Augustus' apotheosis was similar to those of Hercules, Aeneas, Romulus,
and Julius Caesar: compare the descriptions at <i>Met</i> IX 262-72 'interea
quodcumque fuit populabile flammae / Mulciber abstulerat, nec
... quicquam ab imagine ductum / matris habet, tantumque Iouis uestigia
seruat ... maiorque uideri / coepit et <i>augusta</i> fieri grauitate
uerendus. / quem pater omnipotens inter caua nubila raptum / quadriiugo
curru radiantibus intulit astris', <i>Met</i> XIV 603-4 'quicquid in Aenea
fuerat mortale, repurgat [<i>sc</i> Numicius] / et respersit aquis; pars
optima restitit illi', <i>Met</i> XIV 824-28 'abstulit [<i>sc</i> Mars] Iliaden:
corpus mortale per auras / dilapsum tenues ... pulchra subit facies et
puluinaribus altis / dignior', and <i>Met</i> XV 844-46 'Venus ... Caesaris
eripuit membris neque in aera solui / passa recentem animam caelestibus
intulit astris'.</p>

<p><b>25. PATRIS AVGVSTI.</b> <i>Patris</i> to make it clear that Ovid is not speaking
of Tiberius Caesar <i>Augustus</i>.</p>

<p><b>26. CORPVS ... NVMEN.</b> Precisely the same distinction is found in
Velleius' description of Augustus' apotheosis and the start of Tiberius'
reign: 'post redditum caelo patrem et <i>corpus</i> eius humanis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span> honoribus,
<i>numen</i> diuinis honoratum, primum principalium eius operum fuit
ordinatio comitiorum' (II 124 3).</p>

<p><b>27. PAREM VIRTVTE PATRI.</b> Compare <i>EP</i> II viii 31-32 (to Augustus, about
Tiberius) 'perque tibi <i>similem uirtutis imagine</i> natum, / moribus
agnosci qui tuus esse potest'.</p>

<p><b>27-28. FRENA ... IMPERII.</b> The same metaphor at <i>Tr</i> II 41-42 'nec te
quisquam moderatius umquam / <i>imperii</i> potuit <i>frena</i> tenere sui', <i>EP</i>
II ix 33 'Caesar ut <i>imperii</i> moderetur <i>frena</i> precamur', and <i>EP</i> II v
75 (of Germanicus) 'succedatque suis orbis moderator <i>habenis</i>'.</p>

<p>At <i>Fast</i> I 531-34 Ovid uses the same metaphor, as here, of Tiberius'
accession to power: (Carmenta is prophesying Rome's future) 'et penes
Augustos patriae tutela manebit: / hanc fas <i>imperii frena</i> tenere
domum. / inde nepos natusque dei [Tiberius was the adopted son of
Augustus, and therefore the grandson of Julius Caesar], licet ipse
<i>recuset</i>, / pondera caelesti mente paterna feret'. In all of these
passages Ovid may have had in mind <i>Aen</i> VII 600 (of Latinus) 'saepsit
se tectis <i>rerumque</i> reliquit <i>habenas</i>'.</p>

<p><b>27-28. FRENA ... SAEPE RECVSATI ... IMPERII.</b> At <i>Tr</i> V iv 15-16 Ovid had
used <i>frena recusare</i> of a horse: 'fert tamen, ut debet, casus patienter
amaros, / more nec indomiti <i>frena recusat</i> equi'. This perhaps
influenced his choice of words here.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p>

<p><b>27. COACTVS</b> <i>excerpta Scaligeri</i> ROGATVS <i>codd</i>. Ovid is referring to
the second meeting of the Senate after the death of Augustus (the first
meeting had been devoted to funeral arrangements); at this meeting there
had been some confusion over Tiberius' intentions. <i>Rogatus</i> is awkward
to construe, since Tiberius must already have been asked to accept
power: otherwise he could not have refused the offer. The difficulty of
<i>rogatus</i> is clearly shown by the description of the scene in Tacitus:
'et ille [<i>sc</i> Tiberius] uarie disserebat de magnitudine imperii sua
modestia. solam diui Augusti mentem tantae molis capacem: se in partem
curarum ab illo uocatum experiendo didicisse quam arduum, quam subiectum
fortunae regendi cuncta onus, proinde in ciuitate tot inlustribus uiris
subnixa non ad unum omnia deferrent: plures facilius munia rei publicae
sociatis laboribus executuros ... senatu ad infimas obtestationes
procumbente, dixit forte Tiberius se ut non toti rei publicae parem, ita
quaecumque pars sibi mandaretur eius tutelam suscepturum ... fessus
... clamore omnium, expostulatione singulorum flexit paulatim, non ut
fateretur suscipi a se imperium, sed ut negare et <i>rogari</i> desineret'
(<i>Ann</i> I 11-13). Scaliger's conjecture is supported by (and is probably
based on) the corresponding description at Suetonius <i>Tib</i> 24
'principatum ... diu ... recusauit ... tandem quasi <i>coactus</i> et querens
miseram et onerosam iniungi sibi seruitutem, recepit imperium'.</p>

<p>Professor A. Dalzell notes, however, that Suetonius' description is an
imperfect parallel, since <i>coactus</i> is there modified by <i>quasi</i>;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span> he
suggests to me that <i>rogatus</i> could be accepted, if it is taken closely
with <i>recusati</i>&mdash;Tiberius finally accepted what he had many times been
offered and had many times refused.</p>

<p><b>29. VESTAM.</b> Ovid similarly equates Livia with Venus and Juno at <i>EP</i> III
i 117-18 'quae Veneris formam, mores Iunonis habendo / sola est caelesti
digna reperta toro', and implicitly equates her with Juno at <i>Fast</i> I
650 'sola toro magni digna reperta Iouis'. These appear to be instances
of metaphor rather than true equations; but PW XIII,1 913-14 cites
inscriptions indicating a cult of Livia-as-Juno.</p>

<p><b>29-30. LIVIA ... AMBIGVVM NATO DIGNIOR ANNE VIRO.</b> Tiberius is mentioned
by Ovid in connection with Livia at <i>Fast</i> I 649, a description of the
rededication of the temple of Concordia in AD 10: 'hanc tua constituit
genetrix et rebus et ara', but does not figure in Ovid's other mentions
of Livia (<i>Fast</i> V 157-58, <i>Tr</i> II 161-62, <i>EP</i> II viii 29-30, and <i>EP</i>
III i 117-18); these passages would have been written before Tiberius'
assumption of power.</p>

<p>For the coupling of both Augustus and Tiberius with Livia, Professor C.
P. Jones cites '&#7969; &#948;&#959;&#943;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#963;&#954;&#942;&#960;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#963;&#953; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#967;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#945; &#931;&#949;&#946;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#942; / &#922;&#945;&#943;&#963;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#962;'
from an epigram of Ovid's contemporary Honestus.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><b>30. AMBIGVVM.</b> The same use of <i>ambiguum</i> (which may be an Ovidian
peculiarity) at <i>Met</i> I 765-66 '<i>ambiguum</i> Clymene precibus Phaethontis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
an ira / mota magis' and <i>Met</i> XI 235-36 'est specus in medio, natura
factus an arte / <i>ambiguum</i>, magis arte tamen'.</p>

<p><b>30. ANNE.</b> The word is found at <i>Am</i> III xi 49-50 'quicquid eris, mea
semper eris; tu selige tantum, / me quoque uelle uelis, <i>anne</i> coactus
amem' and <i>Fast</i> VI 27-28 (Juno speaking) 'est aliquid nupsisse Ioui,
Iouis esse sororem / fratre magis dubito glorier <i>anne</i> uiro'; the
resemblances between this and the present passage are obvious. B&ouml;mer <i>ad
loc</i> cites instances of <i>anne</i> from Plautus (<i>Amph</i> 173), Terence (<i>Eun</i>
556), Cicero (<i>Fin</i> IV 23, <i>Att</i> XII xiv 2), and Virgil (<i>G</i> I 32 &amp; II
159, <i>Aen</i> VI 864).</p>

<p><b>31. DVOS IVVENES.</b> Germanicus and Drusus. For other mentions of them, see
<i>Tr</i> II 167 'tui, sidus iuuenale, nepotes', <i>Tr</i> IV ii 9 'et qui
Caesareo iuuenes sub nomine crescunt', <i>EP</i> II ii 71-72 'praeterit ipse
suos animo Germanicus annos, / nec uigor est Drusi nobilitate minor',
and <i>EP</i> II viii 33-34.</p>

<p><b>31. ADIVMENTA.</b> The word is rare in verse (but see Lucretius VI 1022 and
Silius XI 605 &amp; XVI 12), and Ovid here seems to be giving a version of
the construction in which people are said to be <i>adiumento</i>, as at Cic
<i>Att</i> XII xxxi 2 'magno etiam adiumento nobis Hermogenes potest esse in
repraesentando ['in making cash payment'&mdash;Shackleton Bailey]', Varro
<i>LL</i> V 90, and <i>Rhet Her</i> III 29. <i>TLL</i> I 704 1 cites "Caecil. <i>mort.</i>
18" for 'duo minores, qui sint adiumento', which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span> resembles the present
passage, but I do not understand the reference: "Caecil." does not
appear in the table of authors.</p>

<p><b>33. NON PATRIA ... SCRIPTA CAMENA.</b> 'Written in a poem that was not in
Latin'. This is the only instance in Ovid of this sense of <i>Camena</i>,
which seems to have been a Horatian idiom: see <i>Carm</i> II xvi 38
'spiritum Graiae tenuem Camenae', <i>Ep</i> I i 1-3 'Prima dicte mihi, summa
dicende Camena ... Maecenas', and <i>AP</i> 275 'tragicae ... Camenae'.
Professor R. J. Tarrant cites Martial XII xciv 5 'fila lyrae moui
Calabris exculta Camenis', which possibly refers to Horace.</p>

<p><b>36. MVRMVR.</b> The hum caused by the exchange of approving comments.
Compare <i>Met</i> XIII 123-24 'finierat Telamone satus, uulgique secutum /
ultima <i>murmur</i> erat'. Livy (XXXII 22 1) has a <i>murmur</i> of mingled
praise and dissent following a speech: '<i>murmur</i> ortum aliorum cum
adsensu, aliorum inclementer adsentientes increpantium'. Other <i>murmura</i>
are disapproving or anxious, as at <i>Met</i> I 206, VIII 431 &amp; IX 421, and
<i>Aen</i> XII 238-39.</p>

<p>The Latin <i>murmur</i> could be quite loud: Martial uses the word of a
lion's roar (VIII liii [lv] 1).</p>

<p><b>40. SEXTA ... BRVMA.</b> The poem must have been written in the winter of 14.</p>

<p><b>41. NOCVERVNT.</b> <i>Nocere</i> again used of the <i>Ars Amatoria</i> at xiv 20
'telaque adhuc demens quae <i>nocuere</i> sequor?' and <i>Tr</i> IV 1 35.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p><b>42. PRIMAQVE TAM MISERAE CAVSA FVERE FVGAE.</b> The second cause was of
course Ovid's <i>error</i> (<i>EP</i> III iii 67-72).</p>

<p><b>43. STVDII COMMVNIA FOEDERA SACRI.</b> Similar references to shared poetic
interests at viii 81 '<i>communia sacra</i> tueri', <i>EP</i> II v 60 (to Salanus,
a famous orator) 'seruat <i>studii foedera</i> quisque sui', <i>EP</i> II ix 63-64
(to Cotys, king of Thrace, who was a writer of verse) 'haec quoque res
aliquid tecum mihi <i>foederis</i> adfert; / eiusdem <i>sacri</i> cultor uterque
sumus', <i>EP</i> II x 17 'sunt tamen inter se <i>communia sacra</i> poetis', and
<i>EP</i> III iv 67 'sunt mihi uobiscum <i>communia sacra</i>, poetae'.</p>

<p>The <i>foedera</i> would carry the obligation of mutual assistance.</p>

<p><b>44. PER NON VILE TIBI NOMEN AMICITIAE.</b> 'By the name of friendship which
is not cheap in your eyes' (Wheeler). Professor R. J. Tarrant cites

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XIV_To_Tuticanus" id="XIV_To_Tuticanus"></a>XIV. To Tuticanus</h2>


<p>In his first poem to Tuticanus, Ovid had promised that other poems would
follow: 'teque canam quacumque nota, <i>tibi carmina mittam</i>' (xii 19).
The present poem was written quite shortly after xii, perhaps in AD 16:
'Haec tibi mittuntur quem sum <i>modo</i> carmine questus / non aptum numeris
nomen habere meis'.</p>

<p>The opening distich indicates that the poem is addressed to Tuticanus.
The dedication is a perfunctory one, however, since he is not referred
to at any other point of the letter: Ovid perhaps felt that he had
fulfilled any obligations he had to Tuticanus with the highly personal
earlier poem.</p>

<p>In 3-14 Ovid expresses at length his wish to be sent anywhere, even the
Syrtes, Charybdis, or the Styx, as long as he can escape Tomis. Such
complaints as these have caused the Tomitans to be angry with him
(15-22). But he has been misunderstood: he was complaining not of the
people but of the land. Hesiod criticized Ascra, Ulysses Ithaca, and
Metrodorus Rome, all with impunity, but Ovid's verse has once more
caused him trouble (23-44). The Tomitans have been as kind to him as the
Paeligni would have been: they have even granted him immunity from
taxation, and publicly crowned him (45-56). After this lengthy account
of the Tomitans, he moves to an unexpectedly quick summing-up: Tomis is
as dear to him as Delos is to Latona (57-60). This conclusion is
immediately undercut by the final distich: his only wish is that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span> Tomis
were not subject to attack, and that it had a better climate. This type
of undercutting is paralleled elsewhere in Ovid's verse: I discuss these
passages at 61-62.</p>

<p>At ix 97-104 Ovid had mentioned the Tomitans' sympathy for him; but the
present poem is unique for the praise Ovid bestows on them, and
furnishes a striking contrast to the horrific picture of Tomis in, for
instance, <i>Tr</i> V x. A primary purpose of Ovid's poetry from exile was to
secure recall, and so he no doubt intentionally emphasized his
hardships; it is clear enough from this poem that at the same time he
was in fact reaching an accommodation with his new conditions of life.</p>

<p><b>3. VTCVMQVE.</b> 'Somehow (in spite of my hardships)'. The word is used by
Ovid only in the poetry of exile, and only in this sense: compare <i>Ibis</i>
9-10 'quisquis is est (nam nomen adhuc <i>utcumque</i> tacebo), / cogit
inassuetas sumere tela manus' and <i>EP</i> III ix 53 'postmodo collectas
[<i>sc</i> litteras] utcumque sine ordine iunxi'. This is a prose sense of
<i>utcumque</i>, common in Livy; when the word is used in verse, it generally
means 'whenever' (Hor <i>Epod</i> XVII 52, <i>Carm</i> I xvii 10, I xxxv 23, II
xvii 11, III iv 29 &amp; IV iv 35) or 'however' (<i>Aen</i> VI 822; the only
instance of the word in Virgil).</p>

<p><b>4. TE</b> <i>Berolinensis Diez. B. Sant. 1, saec xiii Bodleianus Rawlinson G
105<sup>ul</sup></i> ME <i>BCMFHILT</i>. <i>Me</i> seems unlikely to be right, for the phrase
'nil me praeterea quod iuuet inuenies' would not only be awkward in
itself, but would also be in apparent contradiction with the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
'ipsa quoque est inuisa salus', where <i>salus</i> refers back to <i>utcumque
ualemus</i>.</p>

<p><b>4. INVENIES.</b> See at ii 10 <i>Alcinoo</i> (<a href="#Page_164">p 164</a>).</p>

<p><b>5. VLTIMA VOTA.</b> 'My utmost wish'. For this sense of <i>ultimus</i> compare
Cic <i>Fin</i> III 30 'summum bonum, quod <i>ultimum</i> appello', Livy XXVII 10
11 'aurum ... quod ... ad <i>ultimos</i> casus ['the greatest emergencies']
seruabatur promi placuit', Hor <i>Carm</i> II vii 1-2 'O saepe mecum tempus
in <i>ultimum</i> / deducte Bruto militiae duce' (<i>tempus</i> has the same
meaning as <i>casus</i> in the passage from Livy), and Petronius 24 'non
tenui ego diutius lacrimas ... ad <i>ultimam</i> perductus tristitiam'.</p>

<p><b>6. SCILICET</b> seems difficult to explain in this context, and the
translators ignore its presence. ILICET ('at once') should possibly be
read: the corruption of the rarer word to the more common would be easy
enough in view of the final <i>s</i> of the preceding <i>istis</i>.</p>

<p><b>7. MVTER</b> <i>F<sup>1</sup></i> <i>Bodleianus Canon. lat. 1, saec xiii Barberinus lat. 26,

that I have followed editors from Ciofanus to Merkel in printing it.
Gronovius (<i>Obseruationes</i> III 1) made a strong case for <i>muter</i>, citing
Virgil <i>G</i> II 50 (where however the meaning of <i>mutata</i> is disputed),
Hor <i>Sat</i> II vii 63-64 'illa tamen se / non habitu <i>mutatue</i> loco
peccatue superne', Claudian <i>Rap Pros</i> I 62 'rursus corporeos animae
<i>mutantur</i> in artus' (where <i>mittuntur</i> is a variant reading, which Hall
prints), and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span> from Ovid <i>Tr</i> V ii 73-74 'hinc ego dum <i>muter</i>, uel me
Zanclaea [<i>Politianus</i>: Panchea <i>codd</i>] Charybdis / deuoret aque
[<i>Heinsius</i>: atque <i>codd</i>] suis ad Styga mittat aquis', and <i>EP</i> I i 79
'inque locum Scythico uacuum <i>mutabor</i> ab arcu'; compare as well Cic
<i>Balb</i> 31 'ne quis inuitus ciuitate <i>mutetur</i>' and Livy V 46 11 'quod
nec iniussu populi <i>mutari</i> finibus posset'.</p>

<p><b>11. SI QVID EA EST.</b> See at i 17 <i>si quid ea est</i> (<a href="#Page_153">p 153</a>).</p>

<p><b>11. BENE.</b> 'Profitably'. Compare Tac <i>Ann</i> III 44 'miseram pacem uel
bello <i>bene mutari</i>'. The word in this sense is generally used in
describing good commercial investments: see Plautus <i>Cur</i> 679-80
'argentariis <i>male credi</i> qui aiunt, nugas praedicant, / nam et <i>bene</i>
et male <i>credi</i> dico', Sen <i>Suas</i> VII v 'si <i>bene</i> illi pecunias
<i>crediderunt</i> faeneratores', Cic <i>II Verr</i> V 56 'ut intellegerent
Mamertini <i>bene</i> se apud istum tam multa pretia ac munera <i>conlocasse</i>',
and Livy II 42 8.</p>

<p><b>11. COMMVTABITVR.</b> <i>Commutare</i> was a commercial term: it is used of
selling at Cic <i>Clu</i> 129 'ad perniciem innocentis fidem suam et
religionem pecunia <i>commutarit</i>', Columella XII 26 2 'reliquum mustum
... aere <i>commutato</i>', <i>Dig</i> II xv 8 24 'si uinum pro oleo uel oleum pro
uino uel quid aliud <i>commutauit</i>', and <i>CIL</i> I 585 27.</p>

<p><b>12. SI QVID ET INFERIVS QVAM STYGA MVNDVS HABET.</b> Professor R. J. Tarrant
notes another instance of the same idea at Sen <i>Thy</i> 1013-14 'si quid

<p><b>13. GRAMINA.</b> 'Weeds'. Compare <i>Met</i> V 485-86 'lolium tribulique fatigant
/ triticeas messes et inexpugnabile <i>gramen</i>' and <i>Tr</i> V xii 24 'nil
nisi cum spinis <i>gramen</i> habebit ager'; <i>TLL</i> VI.2 2165 65 notes as well
Columella IV 4 5 'omnesque herbas et praecipue <i>gramina</i> extirpare, quae
nisi manu eleguntur ... reuiuiscunt'.</p>

<p>CARMINA, the reading of <i>C</i>, is a frequent corruption of <i>gramina</i>,
occurring as a variant at <i>Met</i> II 841 &amp; XIV 44 and <i>Fast</i> VI 749; it
gives no obvious sense in this passage. Bentley's FLAMINA is ingenious
but unattractive.</p>

<p><b>14. MARTICOLIS</b> is possibly an Ovidian innovation, being found elsewhere
only at <i>Tr</i> V iii 21-22 'adusque niuosum / Strymona uenisti
Marticolamque Geten'.</p>

<p><b>14. NASO.</b> The use of the third person adds to the emotive power of the
tricolon 'ager ... hirundo ... Naso'.</p>

<p><b>15-16. TALIA SVSCENSENT PROPTER MIHI VERBA TOMITAE, / IRAQVE CARMINIBVS
PVBLICA MOTA MEIS.</b> For the similar omission of the <i>est</i> of a perfect
passive, even in the presence of a parallel finite verb, see <i>Met</i> VII
517-18 'Aeacus ingemuit tristique ita uoce <i>locutus</i>: / "flebile
principium melior fortuna secuta est"'.</p>

<p><b>15. SVSCENSENT.</b> The word is foreign to high poetry. It occurs in Ovid
only here and at <i>EP</i> III i 89-90 'nec mihi <i>suscense</i>, totiens si
carmine nostro / quod facis ut facias teque imitere rogo'; the only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
instances from other poetry cited at <i>OLD suscenseo</i> are from <i>Her</i>
XVI-XXI and Martial.</p>

<p>SVSCENSENT is the spelling of <i>C</i>; the other manuscripts have
SVCCENSENT. I print <i>susc-</i> because that is the spelling given by the
ninth-century Hamburg manuscript at <i>EP</i> III i 89 (cited above), where
most manuscripts offer <i>succ-</i>. <i>Succ-</i> is, however, quite possibly
correct, for although <i>susc-</i> is the spelling of the ancient manuscripts
of Plautus and Terence (and of the older manuscripts of the <i>Heroides</i>),
<i>succ-</i> is found at Livy XLII 46 8 in the fifth-century Vienna codex.</p>

<p><b>18. PLECTAR.</b> Similar uses at <i>Tr</i> III v 49 'inscia quod crimen uiderunt
lumina, <i>plector</i>' and <i>EP</i> III iii 64 (Ovid to Amor) 'meque loco
<i>plecti</i> commodiore uelit'.</p>

<p><b>18. AB INGENIO</b> is parallel to <i>per carmina</i> in the preceding line; for
the idiom, see at x 46 <i>ab amne</i> (<a href="#Page_346">p 346</a>).</p>

<p><b>20. TELAQVE ... QVAE NOCVERE SEQVOR.</b> See at xiii 41 <i>nocuerunt</i> (<a href="#Page_406">p 406</a>).</p>

<p><b>23. SED NIHIL ADMISI.</b> 'But I have committed no crime'&mdash;Wheeler. Compare
<i>EP</i> III vi 13 'nec scelus <i>admittas</i> si consoleris amicum'. <i>Admittere</i>
in this sense belonged to daily speech: <i>TLL</i> I 752 77 cites Plaut
<i>Trin</i> 81, Ter <i>HT</i> 956 'quid ego tantum sceleris <i>admisi</i> miser',
Lucilius 690 Marx, and Hor <i>Ep</i> I xvi 53.</p>

<p><b>25. EXCVTIAT.</b> See at viii 17 <i>excutias</i> (<a href="#Page_263">p 263</a>).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p>

<p><b>25. NOSTRI MONIMENTA LABORIS</b> is rather grand, perhaps because Ovid
intended the poem to come near the end of the collection. At <i>Tr</i> III
iii 78 Ovid's <i>libelli</i> are called his most lasting <i>monimenta</i>, and at
<i>EP</i> III v 35 Ovid flatteringly refers to Maximus Cotta's <i>monimenta
laboris</i>.</p>

<p><b>26. LITTERA DE VOBIS EST MEA QVESTA NIHIL.</b> This, of course, is
manifestly untrue. See <i>Tr</i> V x entire, and compare for instance <i>Tr</i> V
vii 45-46 'siue homines [<i>sc</i> specto], uix sunt homines hoc nomine
digni, / quamque lupi saeuae plus feritatis habent'.</p>

<p><b>28. ET QVOD PVLSETVR MVRVS AB HOSTE QVEROR.</b> Compare <i>EP</i> III i 25 'adde
metus <i>et quod murus pulsatur ab hoste</i>'.</p>

<p><b>30. SOLVM</b> <i>BCFILT</i> LOCVM <i>MH</i>. The interchange is very common (examples
at <i>Met</i> I 345 &amp; VII 57); the reverse corruption in some manuscripts at
<i>EP</i> II ii 96 'sit tua mutando gratia blanda <i>loco</i>'.</p>

<p><b>31-40.</b> The argument Ovid here employs ("other have done what I have
done, and not suffered for it") is that used at <i>Tr</i> II 361-538 to
excuse the <i>Ars Amatoria</i>.</p>

<p><b>31-40. VITABILIS.</b> A. G. Lee has ingeniously conjectured VITIABILIS
(<i>PCPhS</i> 181 [1950-51] 3). It would have the sense <i>uitiosa</i>; Lee
compares such words as <i>aerumnabilis</i>, <i>perniciabilis</i>, and
<i>lacrimabilis</i>. He argued that Hesiod nowhere said that Ascra was
'always to be avoided' (although this is a natural inference from <i>Op</i>
639-40) and that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span> variants <i>miserabilis</i>, <i>mirabilis</i>, and
<i>mutabilis</i> 'point to the conclusion that the archetype was here
difficult to make out'. For <i>uitium</i> used of localities he cited <i>EP</i>
III ix 37 'quid nisi de <i>uitio</i> scribam regionis amarae', and for the
word <i>uitiabilis</i> (in the sense 'corruptible') Prudentius <i>Apoth</i> 1045
and <i>Ham</i> 215 (there is a variant <i>uitabilis</i> in a ninth-century
manuscript of the <i>Hamartigenia</i>).</p>

<p>Lee's argument is a good one, but <i>uitabilis</i> does not seem in itself
objectionable enough to be removed from the text. The variant readings
he cites are from unnamed manuscripts of Burman, and are not safe
evidence for the condition of the archetype. It can be said in Lee's
favour that Heinsius and Bentley before him clearly found <i>uitabilis</i>
somewhat strange: Heinsius considered the verse suspect, while Bentley
conjectured VT ILLAVDABILIS.</p>

<p><b>31. ASCRA</b> <i>MFILT</i>. I take ASCRE (<i>BCH</i>) to be a hypercorrect formation
by the scribes; <i>Ascra</i> is metrically guaranteed at 34 'Ascra suo' and
<i>AA</i> I 28 'Ascra tuis'. It is possible that <i>Ascre</i> is correct, although
its use would be strange so close to <i>Ascra</i> in 34: Ovid certainly used
both <i>nympha</i> and <i>nymphe</i> (<i>Her</i> IX 103; <i>Met</i> III 357).</p>

<p><b>32. AGRICOLAE ... SENIS.</b> For Hesiod as an old man compare <i>AA</i> II 3-4
'laetus amans donat uiridi mea carmina palma, / praelata Ascraeo
Maeonioque <i>seni</i>', Prop II xxxiv 77 'tu canis Ascraei <i>ueteris</i>
praecepta poetae', and <i>Ecl</i> VI 69-70 'hos tibi dant calamos, en accipe,
Musae, / Ascraeo quos ante <i>seni</i>'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>

<p><b>35. SOLLERTE ... VLIXE.</b> <i>Sollerte</i> could represent either &#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#942;&#967;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962;
(<i>Il</i> II 173) or &#960;&#959;&#955;&#973;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#962; (<i>Od</i> I 1). I believe
that Ovid was translating &#960;&#959;&#955;&#973;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#962;, since Livius Andronicus
in translating <i>Od</i> I 1 had used <i>uersutus</i> to represent the adjective:
'Virum mihi, Camena, insece <i>uersutum</i>'. It is clear from Cic <i>Brut</i> 236
'genus ... acuminis ... quod erat in reprehendendis uerbis <i>uersutum et
sollers</i>' that the Romans regarded the two adjectives as having much the
same force.</p>

<p>At Hor <i>Sat</i> II v 3-5 &#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#942;&#967;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962; is translated by <i>dolosus</i>:
(Tiresias to Ulysses) 'iamne doloso / non satis est Ithacam reuehi
patriosque penates / aspicere?'.</p>

<p><b>36. HOC TAMEN ASPERITAS INDICE DOCTA LOCI EST.</b> At <i>Od</i> IX 27 Ulysses
describes Ithaca to Alcinous as '&#964;&#961;&#951;&#967;&#949;&#8150;' [=<i>aspera</i>] &#7936;&#955;&#955;' &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8052; &#954;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#961;&#972;&#966;&#959;&#962;'.</p>

<p><b>36. DOCTA</b> (<i>B</i>; <i>C</i> has DOCTVS) seems clearly preferable to DICTA,
offered by most of the manuscripts, which cannot be construed with <i>hoc
... indice</i>. The difficulty with <i>docta</i> is that the passive of <i>docere</i>
seems in general to have been used of the person taught, not the thing;
this is no doubt what induced Riese to print NOTA, found in certain of
Heinsius' manuscripts. Still, the construction seems logical enough in
view of the double accusative construction of the verb in the active.</p>

<p><b>38. SCEPSIVS.</b> Metrodorus<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> of Scepsis (a town on the Scamander, about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
60 kilometres upstream from Troy) was famous for his hatred of Rome; see
Pliny <i>NH</i> XXXIV 34 'signa quoque Tuscanica per terras dispersa quin
[<i>Detlefsen</i>: quae <i>codd</i>] in Etruria factitata sint non est dubium.
deorum tantum putarem ea fuisse, ni Metrodorus Scepsius, cui cognomen
[Professor R. J. Tarrant suggests that '&#924;&#953;&#963;&#959;&#961;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#962;' has fallen
out of the text around this point] a Romani nominis odio inditum est,
propter MM statuarum Volsinios expugnatos obiceret'. According to
Plutarch (<i>Lucullus</i> 22) and Strabo (<i>Geog</i> XIII 1 55), he was a close
confidant of Mithridates; apparently, when on a mission to Tigranes, he
privately advised him not to give Mithridates the requested assistance
against Rome. Tigranes reported this to Mithridates; Metrodorus was
either executed by Mithridates, or died of natural causes while being
sent back to him. Cicero mentions Metrodorus and his phenomenal memory
at <i>de Or</i> II 360.</p>

<p>The present passage is more specific than any other surviving reference
to Metrodorus' anti-Roman sentiments; Ovid had perhaps read the
<i>scripta</i> in question.</p>

<p>As both Cicero and Pliny use the epithet 'Scepsius', Ovid's reference
would have been immediately understood: <i>M&#275;tr&#335;d&#333;rus</i> could not
be used in elegiac verse.</p>

<p><b>41. INTERPRES.</b> The word probably combines the senses of 'translator' and
'interpreter'; that is, the person intentionally misconstrued the

<p>As Andr&eacute; points out, Ovid's statement here that his Latin poems have
caused him difficulty in Tomis indicates that Latin was not as
completely unknown in the city as Ovid claims at, for example, <i>Tr</i> III
xiv 47-48, V vii 53-54 'unus in hoc nemo est populo qui forte Latine /

V xii 53-54 'non liber hic ullus, non qui mihi commodet aurem, /<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
uerbaque significent quid mea norit, adest'; compare as well <i>Tr</i> III
xiv 39-40.</p>

<p><b>42. INQVE NOVVM CRIMEN CARMINA NOSTRA VOCAT.</b> <i>In crimen uocare</i> was a
normal idiom: compare Cic <i>Scaur</i> (e) 'custos ille rei publicae
proditionis est <i>in crimen uocatus</i>' and <i>Fam</i> V xvii 2 'ego te, P.
Sitti, et primis temporibus illis quibus in inuidiam absens et <i>in
crimen uocabare</i> defendi'.</p>

<p><b>42. NOVVM CRIMEN.</b> The <i>uetus crimen</i> was of course the accusation that
the <i>Ars Amatoria</i> was immoral. Professor E. Fantham suggests to me that
<i>nouum</i> could have the meaning 'unprecedented', as at Cic <i>Lig</i> 1
'<i>Nouum crimen</i>, C. Caesar, et ante hunc diem non auditum propinquus
meus ad te Q. Tubero detulit'. Ovid would therefore be saying that the
kind of geographical <i>maiestas</i> the Tomitans were accusing him of did
not constitute a proper charge.</p>

<p><b>43. PECTORE CANDIDVS.</b> 'Kind of heart'. This sense of <i>candidus</i> is
constantly misunderstood by modern commentators. The basic transferred
sense of the word is 'kind' or 'generous towards others'. This can be
clearly seen in such passages as <i>Tr</i> III vi 5-8 'isque erat usque adeo
populo testatus, ut esset / paene magis quam tu quamque ego notus, amor;
/ quique est in caris animi [<i>codd</i>: animo <i>fort legendum</i>] tibi
<i>candor</i> amicis&mdash; / cognita sunt ipsi quem colis ipse uiro', <i>Tr</i> IV x
130-32 'protinus ut moriar non ero, terra, tuus. / siue fauore tuli siue
hanc ego carmine famam, / iure tibi grates, <i>candide</i> lector, ago',<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
<i>Tr</i> V iii 53-54 'si uestrum merui <i>candore</i> fauorem, / nullaque iudicio
littera laesa meo est', <i>EP</i> II v 5, <i>EP</i> III ii 21-22 'aut meus excusat
caros ita <i>candor</i> amicos, / utque habeant de me crimina nulla fauet',
and <i>EP</i> III iv 13 'uiribus infirmi uestro <i>candore</i> ualemus'.</p>

<p>For <i>pectore candidus</i> compare from other authors Hor <i>Epod</i> XI 11-12
'candidum / pauperis ingenium', Val Max VIII xiv praef 'candidis
... animis' and Scribonius Largus praef 5 26 'candidissimo animo'.</p>

<p><b>44. EXTAT ADHVC NEMO SAVCIVS ORE MEO.</b> Ovid makes similar claims at <i>Tr</i>
II 563-65 'non ego mordaci destrinxi carmine quemquam ... <i>candidus</i> a
salibus suffusis felle refugi' and <i>Ibis</i> 1-8 'Tempus ad hoc, lustris
bis iam mihi quinque peractis, / omne fuit Musae carmen inerme meae
... nec quemquam nostri nisi me laesere libelli ... unus ... perennem /
<i>candoris</i> titulum non sinit esse mei'. Andr&eacute; says of the present
passage, 'C'est oublier le po&egrave;me <i>Contre Ibis</i>', but Housman wrote 'Who
was Ibis? Nobody. He was much too good to be true. If one's enemies are
of flesh and blood, they do not carry complaisance so far as to chose
the dies Alliensis for their birthday and the most ineligible spot in
Africa for their birthplace. Such order and harmony exist only in worlds
of our own creation, not in the jerry-built edifice of the demiurge
... And when I say that Ibis was nobody, I am repeating Ovid's own words.
In the last book that he wrote, several years after the Ibis, he said,
ex Pont. IV 14 44, "extat adhuc nemo saucius ore meo"' (1040). Housman
is wrong to adduce this line as though it were a statement made under
oath (compare the claim made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span> in 26 'littera de uobis est mea questa
nihil'). It is nonetheless true that in the extant poems of reproach
Ovid does not identify the person he is addressing.</p>

<p><b>45. ILLYRICA ... PICE NIGRIOR.</b> For the formula, Otto (<i>pix</i>) cites this
passage and <i>Il</i> IV 275-77 '&#957;&#941;&#966;&#959;&#962; ... &#956;&#949;&#955;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#7968;&#973;&#964;&#949; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#963;&#945;'
and from Latin poetry <i>AA</i> II 657-58 'nominibus mollire licet mala:
fusca uocetur / <i>nigrior Illyrica</i> cui <i>pice</i> sanguis erit', <i>Met</i> XII
402-3 'totus <i>pice nigrior</i> atra, / candida cauda tamen', <i>EP</i> III iii
97 'sed neque mutatur [<i>uar</i> fuscatur] <i>nigra pice</i> lacteus umor', <i>Her</i>
XVIII 7 'ipsa uides caelum <i>pice nigrius</i>', and Martial I cxv 4-5 'sed
quandam uolo nocte <i>nigriorem</i>, / formica, <i>pice</i>, graculo, cicada'.</p>

<p><b>45. ILLYRICA ... PICE.</b> A famous mineral pitch was produced near
Apollonia; Andr&eacute; cites Pliny <i>NH</i> XVI 59 'Theopompus scripsit in
Apolloniatarum agro picem fossilem non deteriorem Macedonica inueniri',
<i>NH</i> XXXV 178, and Dioscorides I 73.</p>

<p><b>45. NIGRIOR.</b> The man who was <i>niger</i> had qualities opposite to those of
the man who was <i>candidus</i>; that is, he habitually thought and spoke
evil of others. This is illustrated by Hor <i>Sat</i> I iv 81-85 'absentem
qui rodit amicum, / qui non defendit alio culpante, solutos / qui captat
risus hominum famamque dicacis, / fingere qui non uisa potest, commissa
tacere / qui nequit&mdash;hic <i>niger</i> est, hunc tu, Romane,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span> caueto'. The
same sense is seen at <i>Sat</i> I iv 91 &amp; 100, and at Cic <i>Caec</i> 28
'argentarius Sex. Clodius cui cognomen est Phormio, nec minus <i>niger</i>
nec minus confidens quam ille Terentianus est Phormio'. A similar sense
of <i>ater</i> is seen at Hor <i>Epod</i> VI 15-16 'an si quis <i>atro</i> dente me
petiuerit, / inultus ut flebo puer'; Lindsay Watson <i>ad loc</i> (in an
unpublished University of Toronto dissertation) cites Hor <i>Ep</i> I xix 30
'nec socerum quaerit quem uersibus oblinat <i>atris</i>' for the same
meaning.</p>

<p>A specific connection is often made between blackness and envy: compare
<i>Met</i> II 760 (the home of <i>Inuidia</i> is <i>nigro squalentia tabo</i>) and
Statius <i>Sil</i> IV viii 16-17 (<i>atra Inuidia</i>).</p>

<p>Catullus XCIII 2 'nec scire utrum sis albus an <i>ater</i> homo' and similar
passages at Cic <i>Phil</i> II 41 and Apuleius <i>Apol</i> 16 are examples of an
unrelated idiom meaning 'I know absolutely nothing about you'.</p>

<p><b>46. MORDENDA.</b> For biting as an image of malice, Watson at Hor <i>Epod</i> VI
15 'atro dente' cites Cic <i>Balb</i> 57 'in conuiuiis rodunt, in circulis
uellicant; non illo inimico, sed hoc malo dente carpunt', and Val Max IV
7 ext 2 'malignitatis dentes'; Professor R. J. Tarrant cites Hor <i>Sat</i>
II i 77 and Martial V xxviii 7 'robiginosis cuncta dentibus rodit'. The
image is of course used at times specifically of jealousy; Watson cites
<i>Tr</i> IV x 123-24 'nec, qui detrectat praesentia Liuor iniquo / ullum de
nostris dente momordit opus' and <i>EP</i> III iv 73-74 'scripta placent a
morte fere, quia laedere uiuos / liuor et iniusto carpere dente solet',
and Professor Tarrant cites Hor <i>Carm</i> IV iii 16 'et iam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span> dente minus
mordeor inuido' and Pindar <i>P</i> II 52-53 '&#7952;&#956;&#8050;  &#948;&#8050; &#967;&#961;&#949;&#8060;&#957; /

<p><b>47. MEA SORS</b> = <i>ego sortem grauem passus</i>.</p>

<p><b>48. GRAIOS.</b> The more poetic <i>Graius</i> is more than four times as common
in Ovid as <i>Graecus</i>, which, apart from <i>Her</i> III 2, is only found in
the <i>Fasti</i> (I 330, IV 63 &amp; V 196) and the <i>Tristia</i> (III xii 41, V ii
68 &amp; V vii 11).</p>

<p><b>49. GENS MEA PAELIGNI REGIOQVE DOMESTICA SVLMO.</b> This line is a type of
hendiadys, the first half of the line being redefined by the second. The
other cities of the Paeligni were Corfinium and Superaequum.</p>

<p><b>51-52. INCOLVMI ... SALVOQVE.</b> The two words, equivalent in meaning, were
used together as a common Latin phrase; see Caesar <i>BC</i> I 72 3
'mouebatur etiam misericordia ciuium ... quibus <i>saluis atque
incolumibus</i> rem obtinere malebat' &amp; II 32 12 '<i>saluum atque incolumem</i>
exercitum', Cic <i>Fin</i> IV 19, <i>Diuin in Q Caec</i> 72, <i>Inuen</i> II 169, and
Livy XXIII 42 4 '<i>saluo atque incolumi</i> amico', XXIX 27 3 &amp; XLI 28 9.</p>

<p><b>53. IMMVNIS</b> is also used without a qualifying word or phrase at Plautus
<i>Tr</i> 354, Sall <i>Iug</i> 89 4 'eius [<i>sc</i> oppidi] apud Iugurtham immunes',
Cic <i>Off</i> III 49 'piratas <i>immunes</i>, socios uectigales habemus', <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>Cic
<i>Font</i> 17, Livy XXXIV 57 10 'urbes ... liberas et <i>immunes</i>' &amp; XXXVII 55
7, and <i>CIL</i> XIV 4012 4. For a recent discussion of <i>immunitas</i>, see V.
Nutton, "Two Notes on Immunitas: <i>Digest</i> 27,1,6,10 and 11", <i>JRS</i> 1971,
52-63.</p>

<p><b>54. EXCEPTIS SI QVI MVNERA LEGIS HABENT.</b> The phrase is difficult.
Perhaps legal magistrates enjoyed immunity from taxation; if this is
what Ovid is saying, <i>munera legis</i> is related to such expressions as
<i>consulatus munus</i> (Cic <i>Pis</i> 23) and <i>legationis munus</i> (<i>Phil</i> IX 3).
<i>Munus</i> by itself of magistrates' duties is quite common.</p>

<p>Professor E. Fantham suggests to me, however, that <i>munera legis</i> is a
reference to civic duties, or liturgies, that Greek cities imposed on
certain of their citizens, and Ovid may be saying that citizens
performing such liturgies at Tomis procured exemption from regular
taxation.</p>

<p>Wheeler translates 'those only excepted who have the boon by law'. This
seems difficult; but Professor A. Dalzell notes that the strangeness of
the phrasing may be the results of Ovid's striving for a play on
<i>munera</i>/<i>immunis</i>.</p>

<p><b>55. CORONA.</b> Professor C. P. Jones notes that the <i>corona</i> indicates that
Ovid was probably invested with a local priesthood.</p>

<p><b>57-58. DELIA TELLVS, / ERRANTI TVTVM QVAE DEDIT VNA LOCVM.</b> Accounts of
this at <i>Met</i> VI 186-91 (Niobe speaking) 'Latonam ... cui maxima quondam
/ exiguam sedem pariturae terra negauit! / nec caelo nec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span> humo nec aquis

Delos dedit' and in the passages cited by Williams at <i>Aen</i> III 76 and
Tarrant at Sen <i>Ag</i> 384f.</p>

<p><b>61-62. DI MODO FECISSENT PLACIDAE SPEM POSSET HABERE / PACIS, ET A
GELIDO LONGIVS AXE FORET.</b> In this final distich Ovid unexpectedly
reverts from his gratitude to the Tomitans to the subject of the first
part of the poem, the inhospitality of the region.</p>

<p>This passage provides an example of the technique pointed out in the
<i>Amores</i> by Douglass Parker ("The Ovidian Coda", <i>Arion</i> 8 [1969])
whereby Ovid unexpectedly modifies a poem's tone in the concluding
distich. In <i>Am</i> I x Ovid rails against his girl because she has asked
him for a present: 'nec dare, sed pretium posci dedignor et odi; / quod
nego poscenti, desine uelle, dabo!' (63-64). In <i>Am</i> II xiv Ovid scolds
his girl for having an abortion: 'di faciles, peccasse semel concedite
tuto, / et satis est; poenam culpa secunda ferat!' (43-44). In II xv,
Ovid imagines that he becomes the ring he is giving his girl: 'inrita
quid uoueo? paruum proficiscere munus; / illa data tecum sentiat esse
fide!' (27-28). <i>Am</i> I vii, I xiii, I xiv, and II xiii are other
examples of the device.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XV_To_Sextus_Pompeius" id="XV_To_Sextus_Pompeius"></a>XV. To Sextus Pompeius</h2>


<p>The poem, the fourth and last in the book to be addressed to Pompeius,
is an elaborate appeal to him to continue his assistance.</p>

<p>It starts with the assertion that Pompeius, after the Caesars, is
principally responsible for Ovid's well-being (1-4). The favours
Pompeius has done for Ovid are innumerable and extend throughout his
life (5-10). Ovid will of his own volition declare that he is as much
Pompeius' property as Pompeius' estates in Sicily and Macedonia, his
house in Rome, or his country retreat in Campania; because of Ovid,
Pompeius now has property in the Pontus (11-20). Ovid asks him to
continue working on his behalf (21-24). He knows that he does not have
to urge Pompeius, but he cannot help himself (27-34). No matter whether
he is recalled or not, he will always remember Pompeius; all lands will
hear that it is he who saved Ovid, and that Ovid belongs to him (35-42).</p>

<p>The poem effectively combines a number of commonplaces of the works of
exile, subordinating them to the central theme of Ovid's indebtedness to
Pompeius. The topic of Ovid as Pompeius' property is to a certain extent
foreshadowed in <i>EP</i> I vii, throughout which Ovid refers to himself as a
client of Messalinus' family: 'ecquis in extremo positus iacet orbe
tuorum, / me tamen excepto, qui precor esse tuus?' (5-6); it is found
explicitly at i 35-36 'sic ego sum rerum non ultima, Sexte, tuarum /
tutelaeque feror munus opusque<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span> tuae'. Syme (<i>HO</i> 156) believes that the
addressing of the first and penultimate letters to Pompeius constitutes
a dedication of the book to Pompeius. However, as Syme recognizes, the
abnormal length of the book indicates that it may be a posthumous
collection (see page 4 of the introduction); if so, the arrangement of
the poems is presumably by Ovid's literary executor.</p>

<p>The poem is remarkable for the cluster of legal terms at 11-12. The
passage is evidence for Ovid's expertise and interest in law. For other
indications of this in his works, see at 12 (<a href="#Page_434">p 434</a>).</p>

<p><b>1. SI QVIS ... EXTAT.</b> Pompeius is kept in the third person through line
10; Ovid thereby indicates that he is making a public declaration.</p>

<p><b>1. EXTAT.</b> As Riese pointed out, the choice in 1-2 is between <i>extat
... requirit</i> and <i>extet ... requirat</i>; the problem is that the
manuscripts give <i>extat ... requirat</i>, <i>requirit</i> being found only in a
few manuscripts of Heinsius, while <i>extet</i> is a conjecture of Guethling.
Owen (1894) thought that the ending of <i>extat</i> caused <i>requirit</i> to be
corrupted to <i>requirat</i>; on the other hand, the alteration of <i>extet</i> to
<i>extat</i> would be all but automatic. There is a similar difficulty at
<i>Tr</i> I i 17-18 'si quis ut in populo nostri non immemor illi [=<i>illic</i>], /
si quis qui quid agam forte <i>requirat</i> erit', where most manuscripts
have <i>requiret</i>. Both passages seem to involve the assimilation of
<i>requirere</i> to the mood of the verb immediately following. I print
<i>extat ... requirit</i> in consideration of <i>Tr</i> III x 1-2 'Si quis adhuc
istic <i>meminit</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span> Nasonis adempti, / et <i>superest</i> sine me nomen in urbe
meum' (cited by Lenz), <i>Tr</i> III v 23-24 'si tamen interea quid in his
ego perditus oris&mdash; / quod te credibile est quaerere&mdash;<i>quaeris</i>, agam'
and <i>Tr</i> V vii 5 'scilicet ut semper quid agam, carissime, <i>quaeris</i>'.</p>

<p><b>3. CAESARIBVS</b> = <i>Augusto et Tiberio</i>. Augustus is similarly given
primary credit for Ovid's survival at v 31-32 'uiuit adhuc uitamque tibi
debere fatetur, / quam prius a miti Caesare [=<i>Augusto</i>] munus habet'.</p>

<p><b>4. A SVPERIS ... PRIMVS.</b> The same idiomatic use of <i>ab</i> 'after' at v
25-26 'tempus ab his uacuum Caesar Germanicus omne / auferet; <i>a magnis</i>
hunc colit ille <i>deis</i>' and <i>Fast</i> III 93-94 (of the month of March)
'quintum Laurentes, bis quintum Aequiculus acer, / <i>a tribus</i> hunc
<i>primum</i> turba Curensis habet'.</p>

<p><b>5. TEMPORA ... OMNIA.</b> Compare i 23 '<i>numquam</i> pigra fuit nostris tua
gratia rebus'.</p>

<p><b>5. COMPLECTAR.</b> <i>Complecti</i> in the weak sense 'include, take in' is found
in Ovid only here and at <i>Tr</i> I v 55 'non tamen idcirco <i>complecterer</i>
omnia uerbis'. The usage is common in prose (<i>OLD complector</i> 8).</p>

<p><b>6. MERITIS.</b> Compare i 21-22 'et leuis haec <i>meritis</i> referatur gratia
tantis; / si minus, inuito te quoque gratus ero'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span></p>

<p><b>7-10. QVAE NVMERO TOT SVNT.</b> Ovid is very fond of using this type of
catalogue to indicate great number. Compare <i>AA</i> I 57-59 ('tot habet tua
Roma puellas'), <i>AA</i> II 517-19 ('tot sunt in amore dolores'), <i>AA</i> III
149-50 (the many ways women can ornament themselves), <i>Tr</i> V vi 37-40
(the number of Ovid's ills), and <i>EP</i> II vii 25-28 ('nostrorum ... summa
laborum').</p>

<p><b>8. LENTO CORTICE.</b> 'Tough skin'.</p>

<p><b>8. GRANA.</b> Ovid does not use pomegranates in his similar catalogues
elsewhere. Professor R. J. Tarrant points out to me how Ovid elaborates
the novel item of comparison in a full distich with several picturesque
details (<i>Punica</i>, <i>lento cortice</i>, <i>rubent</i>), then reviews familiar
elements rather more quickly in 9-10, with geography the ordering
principle.</p>

<p><b>9. AFRICA QVOT SEGETES.</b> Compare <i>EP</i> II vii 25 'Cinyphiae segetis citius
numerabis aristas' (the Cinyps was a river in Libya).</p>

<p><b>9. SEGETES ... RACEMOS.</b> Compare <i>AA</i> I 57 'Gargara quot <i>segetes</i>, quot
habet Methymna <i>racemos</i>'.</p>

<p><b>9. TMOLIA TERRA</b> = <i>Lydia</i>. The adjective <i>Tmolius</i> (from <i>Tmolus</i>, a
mountain in Lydia famous for its wines) occurs only here.</p>

<p><b>10. QVOT SICYON BACAS.</b> Compare <i>AA</i> II 518 'caerula quot bacas Palladis
arbor habet'. For Sicyonian <i>bacae</i> compare Virgil <i>G</i> II 519 'Sicyonia
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>baca' and <i>Ibis</i> 317 'oliuifera ... Sicyone'.</p>

<p><b>10. QVOT PARIT HYBLA FAVOS.</b> <i>Fauos</i> stands by a type of metonymy for
<i>apes</i>; compare <i>AA</i> II 517 'quot apes pascuntur in Hybla', <i>AA</i> III 150
'nec quot apes Hybla nec quot in Alpe ferae', and <i>Tr</i> V vi 38 'florida
quam multas Hybla tuetur apes'. For a similar metonymy, see <i>EP</i> II vii
26 'altaque quam multis floreat Hybla thymis'.</p>

<p><b>11. CONFITEOR; TESTERE LICET.</b> 'I make a public deposition; you,
Pompeius, may be a witness'. The deposition is to the effect that Ovid
is now Pompeius' property by virtue of the many gifts Pompeius has made
to him.</p>

<p><b>11. TESTERE ... SIGNATE.</b> Andr&eacute; cites <i>Dig</i> XXII v 22 'curent magistratus
cuiusque loci <i>testari</i> uolentibus et se ipsos et alios testes uel
<i>signatores</i> praebere'.</p>

<p><b>11. SIGNATE, QVIRITES.</b> After addressing Pompeius directly (<i>testere
licet</i>), Ovid addresses those witnessing the <i>mancipatio</i>. As Professor
A. Dalzell points out, this was achieved <i>ex iure Quiritium</i>; there is a
similar direct address to the witnessing <i>Quirites</i> in the formula for
establishing a will (Gaius II 104).</p>

<p>Professor Dalzell also notes the abrupt change of audience; typical of
Propertius, this is a very unusual procedure in Ovid.</p>

<p>For <i>signare</i> used without an object, compare Suet <i>Cl</i> 9 2 'etiam
cognitio falsi testamenti recepta est, in quo et ipse <i>signauerat</i>' &amp;
<i>Nero</i> 17 'cautum ut testamentis primae duae cerae testatorum modo
nomine inscripto uacuae <i>signaturis</i> ostenderentur'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span></p>

<p>Ovid uses <i>testis</i> and <i>signare</i> in a similarly metaphorical sense at
<i>EP</i> III ii 23-24 (he forgives those friends who deserted him in his
disaster) 'sint hac [<i>M (Heinsius)</i>: hi <i>codd</i>] contenti uenia,
<i>signentque</i> [<i>uarr</i> sientque; fugiantque] licebit / purgari factum me
quoque <i>teste</i> suum'</p>

<p><b>12. NIL OPVS EST LEGVM VIRIBVS, IPSE LOQVOR.</b> Ehwald (<i>KB</i> 52) aptly
cites Quintilian V vii 9 'duo genera sunt testium, aut uoluntariorum aut
eorum quibus in [in <i>add editio Aldina</i>] iudiciis publicis lege
denuntiari solet ['or those who are summoned <i>sub poena</i> in trials']'.</p>

<p>The reference in this passage to a legal procedure is rather curious, as
is the connected reference in 41-42. But it is clear from Ovid's verse
that he had a solid practical expertise and interest in law. In his
youth he had been one of the <i>tresuiri monetales</i> or <i>capitales</i> (<i>Tr</i>
IV x 33-34), and had also served in the centumviral court (<i>Tr</i> II
93-94; <i>EP</i> III v 23-24). He must have been known for his knowledge of
law as well as for his fairness in order to be selected as arbitrator in
private cases: 'res quoque priuatas statui sine crimine iudex, / deque
mea fassa est pars quoque uicta fide' (<i>Tr</i> II 95-96). E. J. Kenney has
presented some interesting statistics concerning the frequent occurrence
of legal terms in Ovid's poetry ("Ovid and the Law", <i>Yale Classical
Studies</i> XXI [1969] 241-63) comparing the number of occurrences of
certain legal terms in Ovid and in Lucretius, Catullus, Virgil,
Propertius, Tibullus, and the <i>Odes</i> of Horace. <i>Ius</i> and <i>lex</i> are not
much more common in Ovid than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span> in the other poets (the proportions being
134:59 and 74:60 respectively for Ovid and the other poets combined);
this is not surprising, since these common words could hardly be
considered technical terms. <i>Arbiter</i> (7:4) and <i>lis</i> (23:10) are not
much more common in Ovid than in the other poets. But it will be seen
from the following list how fond Ovid was of legal terminology:
<i>legitimus</i> (16:0), <i>iudex</i> (47:12), <i>iudicium</i> (39:7), <i>index</i> (26:1),
<i>indicium</i> (36:8), <i>arbitrium</i> (23:6), <i>reus</i> (23:5), <i>uindex</i> (26:5),
<i>uindicare</i> (16:6), <i>uindicta</i> (11:0), <i>asserere</i> (3:0), <i>assertor</i>
(1:0). Compare as well the play on legal terminology at <i>AA</i> I 83-86
(with Hollis's notes), and the use of such terms as <i>addicere</i> (<i>Met</i> I
617), <i>fallere depositum</i> (<i>Met</i> V 480 &amp; IX 120), <i>usus communis</i> (<i>Met</i>
VI 349), <i>transcribere</i> (<i>Met</i> VII 173), <i>primus heres</i> (<i>Met</i> XIII
154), <i>rescindere</i> (<i>Met</i> XIV 784), <i>accensere</i> (<i>Met</i> XV 546),
<i>subscribere</i> (<i>Tr</i> I ii 3), <i>sub condicione</i> (<i>Tr</i> I ii 109), and
<i>acceptum referre</i> (<i>Tr</i> II 10).</p>

<p><b>13. OPES ... PATERNAS.</b> Pompeius appears to have been very wealthy. Seneca
speaks of the wealth of a Pompeius (presumably the son of Ovid's
patron&mdash;so Syme <i>Ten Studies</i> 82, <i>HO</i> 162), who was murdered by Gaius
Caligula (<i>Tranq</i> 11 10).</p>

<p><b>13. REM PARVAM</b> <i>MHIT</i> PARVAM REM <i>BCFL</i>. Either reading is possible
enough. On balance, I believe <i>paruam rem</i> to be an intentional scribal
alteration to avoid the incidence of a spondaic word in the fourth foot
of the hexameter; for a discussion of the phenomenon, see at i 11
<i>uellem cum</i> (<a href="#Page_150">p 150</a>).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span></p>

<p>In an older poet, the alliteration of <i>paruam pone paternas</i> would be a
strong argument for the reading (see page 15 of Munro's introduction to
his commentary on Lucretius), but Ovid did not use the device in his
poetry.</p>

<p><b>15. TRINACRIA</b> = <i>S&#301;c&#301;l&#301;a</i>, unusable because it begins with three consecutive short vowels;
compare <i>Met</i> V 474-76 (of Ceres)
'terras tamen increpat omnes / ingratasque uocat nec frugum munere
dignas, / <i>Trinacriam</i> ante alias'.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; avoids the literal meaning of the passage, joining <i>terra</i> with
<i>Trinacria</i> as well as with <i>regnataque ... Philippo</i> and taking it to
mean 'estate': 'ta terre de Trinacrie et celle o&ugrave; r&eacute;gna Philippe'. But
this sense of <i>terra</i> is rare in Latin (Martial IX xx 2, Apuleius <i>Met</i>
IX 35), it is difficult to see how <i>regnataque ... Philippo</i> could stand
as an epithet in such a case, and it is clear enough that Ovid is
imitating <i>Aen</i> III 13-14 '<i>terra</i> ... acri quondam <i>regnata Lycurgo'</i>,
as he does at <i>Her</i> X 69 'tellus iusto regnata parenti', <i>Met</i> VIII 623
'arua suo quondam regnata parenti', and <i>Met</i> XIII 720-21 'regnataque
uati / Buthrotos Phrygio'. In these lines Ovid states that Pompeius owns
Sicily, Macedonia, and Campania, and by the hyperbole indicates the size
of Pompeius' holdings. Seneca similarly mentions how the Pompeius
murdered by Gaius Caligula possessed 'tot flumina ... in suo orientia, in
suo cadentia'.</p>

<p><b>16. QVAM DOMVS AVGVSTO CONTINVATA FORO.</b> Compare v 9-10 'protinus inde
domus uobis Pompeia petetur: / <i>non est Augusto iunctior ulla foro'</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span></p>

<p><b>18. QVAEQVE RELICTA TIBI, SEXTE, VEL EMPTA TENES.</b> The line seems rather
prosaic. For the thought, compare Cic <i>Off</i> II 81 'multa
<i>hereditatibus</i>, multa <i>emptionibus</i>, multa dotibus tenebantur sine
iniuria'; for this sense of <i>relicta</i>, compare Nepos <i>Att</i> 13 2 'domum
habuit ... ab auunculo hereditate <i>relictam</i>', Livy XXII 26 1 'pecunia a
patre <i>relicta</i>', and Martial X xlvii 3 'res non parta labore, sed
<i>relicta</i>'.</p>

<p><b>19. TAM TVVS EN EGO SVM.</b> Professor A. Dalzell notes the play on the dual
sense of <i>tuus</i> (devoted/belonging to you) which is probably the basis
of the entire poem. For <i>tuus</i> 'devoted' compare <i>Tr</i> II 55-56 '[iuro
...] hunc animum fauisse tibi, uir maxime, meque, / qua sola potui,
mente fuisse <i>tuum</i>' and the other passages cited at <i>OLD tuus</i> 6.</p>

<p><b>19. MVNERE.</b> The word is difficult. 'Gift' seems strange in view of the
stress placed on Pompeius' ownership of Ovid. Professor E. Fantham
suggests to me that the phrase could mean 'by virtue of whose sad
<i>service</i> you cannot say you own nothing in the Pontus', while Professor
R. J. Tarrant suggests that <i>munere</i> could mean 'responsibility,
charge', with <i>cuius</i> (=<i>mei</i>) as an objective genitive.</p>

<p><b>21. ATQVE VTINAM POSSIS, ET DETVR AMICIVS ARVVM.</b> This elliptical use of
<i>posse</i> seems to be colloquial. The only instance cited by <i>OLD</i>
<i>possum</i> 2a from verse is Prop IV vii 74 'potuit [<i>uar</i> patuit], nec
tibi auara fuit'; there as well the tone is that of lively speech.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span></p>

<p><b>21. AMICIVS ARVVM.</b> The same phrase at <i>Met</i> XV 442-43 (Helenus to
Aeneas) 'Pergama rapta feres, donec Troiaeque tibique / externum patrio
contingat <i>amicius aruum</i>'. The use of the adjective <i>amicus</i> of things
rather than person is in the main a poetic usage, but compare Cic
<i>Quinct</i> 34 'breuitas postulatur, quae mihimet ipsi <i>amicissima</i> est',
<i>ND</i> II 43 'fortunam, quae <i>amica</i> uarietati constantiam respuit', and
<i>Att</i> XII xv 'nihil est mihi <i>amicius</i> solitudine'; other instances in
the elder Pliny and Columella.</p>

<p><b>22. REMQVE TVAM PONAS IN MELIORE LOCO.</b> Compare <i>EP</i> I iii 77-78 'liquit
Agenorides Sidonia moenia Cadmus / poneret ut muros <i>in meliore loco</i>'.</p>

<p><b>24. NVMINA PERPETVA QVAE PIETATE COLIS.</b> Tiberius and Germanicus are
meant. For Pompeius' devotion to Germanicus, compare v 25-26 'tempus ab
his uacuum Caesar Germanicus omne / auferet; a magnis hunc colit ille
deis'.</p>

<p><b>25-26. ERRORIS NAM TV VIX EST DISCERNERE NOSTRI / SIS ARGVMENTVM MAIVS
AN AVXILIVM.</b> This distich does not belong in the text: it is in itself
unintelligible, and interrupts a natural progression from 24 to 27. I am
not certain that the distich is a simple interpolation, since there is
nothing in the context to which it is an obvious gloss. Possibly it has
been inserted from another letter from exile, in which its meaning would
have been clear from context.</p>

<p><i>Argumentum</i> is difficult. Wheeler translates, 'For 'tis hard to
distinguish whether you are more the proof of my mistake or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
relief', and notes 'Apparently Pompey could prove (<i>argumentum</i>) that
"error" which Ovid regarded as the beginning of his woes'. But this
seems a strange thing to say, for Ovid's <i>error</i> was hardly in need of
demonstration.</p>

<p><i>Auxilium</i> is used in its medical sense, <i>erroris</i> being equivalent to
<i>morbi</i> or <i>uulneris</i>; compare <i>RA</i> 48 'uulneris auxilium' and the
passages collected at <i>OLD remedium</i> 1.</p>

<p><b>25. DISCERNERE.</b> Gronovius argued (<i>Obseruationes</i> III xiii) that
DECERNERE (<i>MI<sup>1</sup></i>) should be read here, since <i>decernere</i> has the
required sense 'uel decertare uel iudicare et certum statuere', whereas
<i>discernere</i> means 'separare, dirimere, distinguere, diuidere'. On the
evidence of the lexica, however, Gronovius' distinction breaks down,
since <i>discernere</i> meaning 'decide, determine, make out' is common
enough: compare Sallust <i>Cat</i> 25 3 'pecuniae an famae minus parceret
haud facile <i>discerneres</i>', Cic <i>Rep</i> 2 6 'ne nota quidem ulla pacatus
an hostis sit <i>discerni</i> ac iudicari potest', Varro <i>LL</i> VII 17 'quo
<i>discernitur</i> homo mas an femina sit', and Livy XXII 61 10 'quid ueri
sit <i>discernere</i>'. I therefore let <i>discernere</i> stand.</p>

<p><b>29-30. ET PVDET ET METVO SEMPERQVE EADEMQVE PRECARI / NE SVBEANT ANIMO
TAEDIA IVSTA TVO.</b> Compare <i>EP</i> III vii entire (an apology to his friends
for the monotony of his verse), and especially the opening lines: 'Verba
mihi desunt eadem tam saepe roganti, / iamque pudet uanas fine carere
preces. / taedia consimili fieri de carmine uobis, / quidque petam
cunctos edidicisse reor'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span></p>

<p><b>30. SVBEANT ANIMO.</b> <i>Subire animo</i> occurs also
at <i>Tr</i> I v 13. Ovid uses <i>subire</i> with the dative several times in the
poetry of exile (<i>Tr</i> I vii 9, II 147, III iii 14 &amp; V vii 58; <i>EP</i> I ix
11, II x 43 &amp; IV iv 47), but not beforehand; earlier he has the
accusative (<i>Met</i> XII 472) or the simple verb (<i>Met</i> XV 307). The dative
construction is taken up by the author of the later <i>Heroides</i> (XVI 99,
XVIII 62).</p>

<p><b>31. RES IMMODERATA CVPIDO EST.</b> <i>Cupido</i> similarly called <i>immoderata</i> at
Apuleius <i>Plat</i> II 21; elsewhere qualified as <i>immodica</i> (Livy VI 35 6)
and <i>immensa</i> (<i>Aen</i> VI 823, Tac <i>Ann</i> XII 7).</p>

<p><b>33. DELABOR.</b> Cicero uses the word for moving from one subject to another
(<i>OLD delabor</i> 5b); here the metaphorical sense 'fall' is still active.</p>

<p><b>34. IPSA LOCVM PER SE LITTERA NOSTRA ROGAT.</b> This line as it stands is
clearly corrupt. I do not understand Wheeler's 'my very letters of their
own accord seek the opportunity'; Andr&eacute;'s 'c'est la lettre qui,
d'elle-meme, demande le sujet' seems equally difficult, although <i>locus</i>
can certainly have the meaning 'subject, topic of discussion' (<i>OLD</i>
<i>locus</i> 24b).</p>

<p>The only parallel I have found is <i>Fast</i> II 861 'iure uenis, Gradiue:
<i>locum tua tempora poscunt</i>'. If <i>littera</i> is retained in the present
passage, this parallel is of little assistance, since <i>locum</i> there
means 'a place within a larger work', and Ovid's poetry cannot ask for a
<i>locus</i> in that sense. Taking the passage from the <i>Fasti</i> as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span> a
parallel, I once thought that Ovid wrote <i>ipsa locum pro se tristia
nostra rogant</i> (or <i>petunt</i>); for the noun <i>triste</i> compare <i>Fast</i> VI
463 'scilicet interdum miscentur <i>tristia</i> laetis', <i>Ecl</i> III 80-81
'<i>triste</i> lupus stabulis, maturis frugibus imbres, / arboribus uenti,
nobis Amaryllidis irae', and Hor <i>Carm</i> I xvi 25-26 'nunc ego mitibus /
mutare quaero <i>tristia</i>'. I now consider this unlikely, since the
personal adjective <i>nostra</i> with <i>tristia</i> seems unidiomatic; but I
still believe that <i>littera</i> is the key to the corruption.</p>

<p>Professor R. J. Tarrant has tentatively suggested something like <i>inque
locum ... redit</i>, but questions whether <i>in locum</i>, even just after
<i>eodem</i>, can have the sense <i>in eundem locum</i>. Professor Tarrant also
points out to me the possible relevance of <i>locus</i> in the sense <i>locus
communis</i> (compare Sen <i>Suas</i> I 9 'dixit ... <i>locum</i> de uarietate
fortunae'); Ovid might be saying that his poetry had made rather
frequent use of the <i>locus de exilio</i>. In this case, <i>rogat</i> would
require emendation.</p>

<p>One of Heinsius' manuscripts read <i>per se ... facit</i>, which is just
possibly correct. Heinsius proposed <i>pro se ... facit</i>, which I do not
understand.</p>

<p><b>35. HABITVRA</b> is a good instance of the future participle used to express
what is inevitably destined to happen (with <i>Parca</i> balancing in the
pentameter); for the sense, see Tarrant on Sen <i>Ag</i> 43 'daturus coniugi
iugulum suae'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span></p>

<p><b>37. INOBLITA</b> = <i>memori</i>. Apparently the only instance of the word in
classical Latin.</p>

<p><b>39. CAELO ... SVB VLLO.</b> Bentley oddly conjectured ILLO, the reading of
<i>M<sup>ac</sup></i>, which gives the sense 'under the Tomitan sky'. This obviously
contradicts the following <i>transit nostra feros si modo Musa Getas</i>.</p>

<p><b>41. SERVATOREM</b> occurs in Ovid only here and at <i>Met</i> IV 737-38 (of
Perseus) 'auxiliumque domus <i>seruatoremque</i> fatentur / Cassiope
Cepheusque pater'. In prose it is several times used in a civic context
(Cic <i>Pis</i> 34, <i>Planc</i> 102, Livy VI 20 16 &amp; XLV 44 20; <i>CIL</i> IX 4852 in
a dedication to <i>Ioui optimo maximo seruatori conseruatori ... ex uoto
suscepto</i>). The solemn overtones of <i>seruatorem</i> must be part of what
Ovid means for his own land and for the rest of the world to hear and
know; the poem thus ends with an implied pronouncement to balance the
public statement of the opening.</p>

<p><b>42. MEQVE TVVM LIBRA NORIT ET AERE MAGIS.</b> This line clearly refers to
<i>mancipatio</i>, the receiving of property (including slaves), which is
described by Gaius as follows: 'adhibitis non minus quam [<i>Boeth.</i>: quod
<i>cod</i>] quinque testibus ciuibus Romanis puberibus, et praeterea alio
eiusdem condicionis qui libram aeneam teneat, qui appellatur libripens
['scale-holder'&mdash;de Zulueta], is qui mancipio accipit, aes [aes <i>add
Boeth.</i>] tenens, ita dicit: "hunc ego hominem ex iure [<i>Boeth.</i>: i&#363;st
<i>cod</i>] Quiritium meum esse aio isque mihi emptus esto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span> hoc aere aeneaque
libra", deinde aere percutit libram, idque aes dat ei a quo mancipio
accipit quasi pretii loco' (I 119).</p>

<p>MAGIS is found as a secondary reading in <i>F</i> and in the
thirteenth-century <i>Barberinus lat. 26</i>; the reading of most manuscripts
is MINVS, which seems to me impossible. Several explanations of <i>minus</i>
have been advanced:</p>

<p>(i) Gronovius took the line to mean 'tuus sum, immo mancipium tuum, nisi
quod sola libra et aes mea mancipatione abfuerunt'. This retention of
<i>minus</i>, however, involves Ovid in a qualifying retraction just when he
seems to be aiming for a ringing conclusion. As well, the instances of
<i>minus</i> cited by Gronovius do not in fact illustrate this passage: among
them are <i>EP</i> I vii 25-26 'uno / nempe salutaris quam prius ore minus',
<i>Met</i> XII 554-55 'bis sex Herculeis ceciderunt me minus uno ['except for
me alone'] / uiribus', and Manilius I 778 'Tarquinio ... minus reges',
'the kings, except for Tarquin'.</p>

<p>Gronovius seems to have realized that difficulties remained, and
proposed to read NOVIT in 42 and make 41-42 a relative clause dependent
on <i>tellus</i> in 38, so that the concluding lines of the poem would mean
'mea tellus, Sulmo, Roma, Italia, me tuum esse audiet. sed audiet idem
etiam, quaecumque sub alia quauis caeli parte terra posita est, et te,
meum seruatorem, meque, libra et aere tuum, minus nouit'. Once again,
<i>minus</i> seems to weaken the poem fatally.</p>

<p>(ii) Ehwald (<i>KB</i> 71) followed Gronovius' second explanation, retaining
the manuscripts' <i>norit</i>, and glossing 'tellus, quae sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span> ullo caelo
posita est et te, meae salutis seruatorem, meque, libra et aere tuum,
minus norit'.</p>

<p>(iii) N&eacute;methy followed Gronovius' first explanation, adding as an
illustration <i>AA</i> I 643-44 'ludite, si sapitis, solas impune puellas: /
hac <i>minus</i> [<i>Burman</i>: magis <i>codd</i>] est una fraude tuenda [<i>Naugerius
ex codd suis</i>: pudenda <i>codd</i>] fides'. The citation does not strengthen
the case for <i>minus</i>.</p>

<p>(iv) Andr&eacute; wrote '<i>Minus</i> me para&icirc;t avoir le sens de <i>citra</i> "sans aller
jusqu'&agrave;", i.e. "sans m&ecirc;me avoir recours &agrave; la mancipation": "tu es mon
ma&icirc;tre de ma propre volont&eacute;, et non, comme tu l'es de tes autres
propri&eacute;t&eacute;s, par achat."' But the meaning seems to weaken the force of
the poem.</p>

<p>I have with reluctance adopted <i>libra ... et aere magis</i>, taking it in
the sense <i>magis quam libra et aere</i> ('I am yours even more than I would
be if I had been acquired through <i>mancipatio</i>'). The closest parallel I
have found for this compressed use of the ablative is the idiom at v 7
'luce minus decima', 'before the tenth day'.</p>

<p>Of the other readings, <i>F<sup>1</sup></i>'s <i>tuum ... datum</i> cannot itself be correct,
although it may offer a clue to the truth. Heinsius' <i>tuum ... tuum</i> is
grammatical enough, but (as Professor R. J. Tarrant points out to me)
makes Ovid say that he is Pompeius' literally through <i>mancipatio</i>. As
well, the repetition seems odd. Rappold's <i>tuae ... manus</i> cannot be
right, since <i>manus</i> did not have the sense of <i>mancipium</i>, except for
the limited meaning of a husband's authority over his wife. Still,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
Rappold's conjecture may be a step in the right direction, particularly
in view of v 39-40 'pro quibus ut meritis referatur gratia, iurat / se
fore <i>mancipii</i> tempus in omne <i>tui</i>'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XVI_To_a_Detractor" id="XVI_To_a_Detractor"></a>XVI. To a Detractor</h2>


<p>The anonymous detractor to whom Ovid apparently addresses this poem is
probably fictional; at 47 he substitutes <i>Liuor</i>, dropping the pretence
of speaking to a single enemy.</p>

<p>Ovid begins the poem by asking his detractor why he criticizes Ovid's
verse. A poet's fame increases after his death; Ovid's fame was great
even while he was still alive (1-4). There were many poets contemporary
with Ovid (5-38). There were also younger poets, not yet published, whom
he will not name, with the necessary exception of Cotta Maximus (39-44).
Even among such poets, he had a reputation. Envy should therefore cease
to torment him; he has lost everything but life, which is left only so
that he can continue to experience pain (45-50).</p>

<p>The poem is of particular interest because of the catalogue of the poets
of the earlier part of the reign of Tiberius. It is a reminder of how
much Latin verse has been lost, for of the poets listed only Grattius
survives.</p>

<p>Similar catalogues of poets are found at Prop II xxxiv 61-92 and <i>Am</i> I
xv 9-30, the poets listed being however not contemporaries but
illustrious predecessors. <i>Tr</i> IV x 41-54 is complementary to the
present poem, being a list of the leading Roman poets at the beginning
of Ovid's career. All of these poems come last in their book, and it
seems clear enough that the present poem was meant to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span> close a published
collection. Other links exist with the earlier poems: mention is
similarly made in them of the poet's fame after his death (Prop II xxxiv
94, <i>Am</i> I xi 41-42, <i>Tr</i> IV x 129-30), and <i>Am</i> I xv (which Professor
R. J. Tarrant suggests may have ended the original edition in five books
of the <i>Amores</i>) is, like the present poem, addressed to <i>Liuor</i>.</p>

<p><b>1. INVIDE, QVID LACERAS NASONIS CARMINA RAPTI.</b> Compare the question that
opens <i>Am</i> I xv 'Quid mihi, Liuor edax, ignauos obicis annos, /
ingeniique uocas carmen inertis opus'. For <i>inuide ... laceras</i> compare
Cic <i>Brutus</i> 156 '<i>inuidia</i>, quae solet <i>lacerare</i> plerosque'.</p>

<p><b>1. LACERAS.</b> <i>Lacerare</i> 'attack verbally' is a prose usage, found in
Cicero, the historians, and the elder Seneca (<i>OLD lacero</i> 5; <i>TLL</i>
VII.2 827 50).</p>

<p>The primary meaning of <i>lacerare</i> behind this usage is <i>mordere</i>;
<i>lacerare</i> is found in this literal sense at Cic <i>De or</i> II 240
'<i>lacerat</i> lacertum Largi <i>mordax</i> Memmius', Phaedrus I xii 11
'<i>lacerari</i> coepit <i>morsibus</i> saeuis canum', and Sen <i>Clem</i> I 25 1.</p>

<p>For <i>mordere</i> in the same transferred sense, see at xiv 46 <i>mordenda</i>
(<a href="#Page_424">p 424</a>).</p>

<p><b>1. NASONIS ... RAPTI.</b> 'Of Ovid, who is now dead'. For <i>rapti</i>, see at xi
5 <i>rapti</i> (<a href="#Page_362">p 362</a>).</p>

<p><b>2. NON SOLET INGENIIS SVMMA NOCERE DIES.</b> The same thought at <i>Am</i> I xv
39-40 'pascitur in uiuis Liuor; post fata quiescit, / cum suus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span> ex
merito quemque tuetur honos' and <i>EP</i> III iv 73-74 'scripta placent a
morte fere, quia laedere uiuos / Liuor et iniusto carpere dente solet'.</p>

<p><b>3. CINERES</b> = <i>mortem</i>. B&ouml;mer at <i>Met</i> VIII 539 <i>post cinerem</i> (where
<i>cinerem</i>, as B&ouml;mer saw, means 'cremation'), cites among other passages
Prop III i 35-36 'meque inter seros laudabit Roma nepotes: / illum <i>post
cineres</i> auguror esse diem', Martial I i 2-6 'Martialis ... cui, lector
studiose, quod dedisti / uiuenti decus atque sentienti, / rari <i>post
cineres</i> habent poetae' and Martial VIII xxxviii 16 'hoc et <i>post
cineres</i> erit tributum'.</p>

<p><b>3. AT</b> is my correction for the manuscripts' ET. The point that Ovid was
famous <i>even</i> while alive is made by <i>tum quoque</i> later in the verse;
the only meaning that could therefore be given to <i>et mihi nomen</i> is
'even I had a name, even when I was alive', which is inappropriate,
since in this poem Ovid is not belittling his poetic talent.</p>

<p><i>At</i> seems to be the obvious solution, giving the sense 'poets usually
become famous after they die; I, <i>however</i>, was famous even while
alive'. Compare <i>Tr</i> IV x 121-22 (to his Muse) 'tu mihi, quod rarum est,
uiuo sublime dedisti / nomen, ab exequiis quod dare fama solet' and
Martial I i 2-6 (cited in the previous note). The more usual situation
of obscurity during the poet's lifetime followed by posthumous fame is
described at Prop III i 21-24.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span></p>

<p>Professor C. P. Jones points out to me that <i>et</i> can have an adversative
sense (<i>OLD et</i> 14a). But the two instances there cited from Augustan
verse are examples of <i>nec ... et</i> (<i>Fast</i> V 530; <i>Tr</i> V xii 63 'nec
possum <i>et</i> cupio non nullos ducere uersus'). Where <i>et</i> alone carries
the adversative sense, it is generally used to join two opposing verbs
or verbal phrases: compare Cic <i>Tusc</i> I 6 'fieri ... potest ut recte quis
sentiat <i>et</i> id quod sentit polite eloqui non possit' and Sen <i>NQ</i> II 18
'quare aliquando non fulgurat <i>et</i> tonat?'.</p>

<p><b>4. CVM VIVIS ADNVMERARER.</b> For Ovid's considering himself already dead,
compare <i>EP</i> I ix 56 'et nos extinctis adnumerare potest' and <i>EP</i> I vii
9-10 'nos satis est inter glaciem Scythicasque sagittas / uiuere, si
uita est mortis habenda genus'.</p>

<p>Ovid is the first poet to use <i>adnumerare</i> in this sense ('reckon in
with'), and only in his poems of exile; it is afterwards found at <i>Her</i>
XVI 330 and Manilius V 438.</p>

<p><b>5-36.</b> It is possible to discern a rough order in the catalogue of names;
first come the writers of epic and Pindaric verse (5-28), then the
dramatists (29-31), and finally the writers of lighter verse (32-36).</p>

<p><b>5. CVM FORET ET</b> <i>FHT</i> CVMQVE FORET <i>BCMIL</i>. Clearly either <i>et</i> or
<i>-que</i> was lost, and one or both inserted to restore the metre. <i>Cumque</i>
would be a continuation of <i>at mihi nomen ...</i>, which seems an inelegant
construction. <i>Cum foret et</i>, introducing a sentence of forty-two lines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
ending in 'dicere si fas est, claro mea nomine Musa / atque inter tantos
quae legeretur erat' seems preferable; this very long sentence serves
not as a continuation of the statement in 3-4, but as evidence for it.</p>

<p><b>5. MARSVS.</b> Domitius Marsus<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> is often mentioned by Martial as a writer
of epigram, sometimes being coupled with Catullus and Albinovanus Pedo
(I praef, II lxxi 3 &amp; lxxvii 5, V v 6, VII xcix 7). A friend of
Maecenas, he wrote an epic poem on the Amazons (Martial IV xxix 8), and
at least nine books of <i>fabellae</i> (Charisius I 72 Keil). Quintilian
quotes from his treatise on <i>urbanitas</i> (VI iii 102 ff.); and he is
cited as an authority by the elder Pliny (<i>NH</i> I 34).</p>

<p>The scholiasts and grammarians preserve seven fragments (Morel 110-11),
the most interesting being the four lines on the death of Tibullus: 'Te
quoque Vergilio comitem non aequa, Tibulle, / Mors iuuenem campos misit
ad Elysios, / ne foret aut elegis molles qui fleret amores / aut caneret
forti regia bella pede'.</p>

<p><b>5. MAGNIQVE RABIRIVS ORIS.</b> Similar phrasing at Virgil <i>G</i> III 294 'magno
nunc ore sonandum', Prop II x 12 'magni nunc erit oris opus', and <i>AA</i> I
206 (to Gaius) 'et magno nobis ore sonandus eris'. In the last two
passages, as here, there is a specific reference to epic verse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span></p>

<p><b>5. RABIRIVS.</b> Velleius Paterculus (II 36 3) mentions Rabirius
(Schanz-Hosius 267-68 [&sect; 316]; Bardon 73-74) alongside Virgil: 'paene
stulta est inhaerentium oculis ingeniorum enumeratio, inter quae maxima
nostri aeui eminent princeps carminum Vergilius Rabiriusque'. Quintilian
speaks of him with rather less admiration: 'Rabirius ac Pedo non indigni
cognitione, si uacet' (X i 90). Seneca (<i>Ben</i> VI 3 1) quotes a passage
of his with Mark Antony speaking; presumably one of his poems dealt with
the civil war.</p>

<p>Five short fragments of Rabirius survive (Morel 120-21).</p>

<p><b>6. ILIACVSQVE MACER.</b> Pompeius Macer<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> was one of Ovid's closest
friends; he is the addressee of <i>Am</i> II xviii and <i>EP</i> II x. The son of
Theophanes of Mytilene, Pompey's confidant, he was intimate with
Tiberius (Strabo XIII 2 3); under Augustus he had served as procurator
of Asia and had been placed in charge of the libraries at Rome (Suet
<i>Iul</i> 56 7). Two poems in the Greek Anthology are generally attributed
to him (VII ccxix; IX xxviii).</p>

<p><i>Iliacus</i> is explained by <i>Am</i> II xviii 1-3 'Carmen ad iratum dum tu
perducis Achillem ['while you are writing a poem about the Trojan war up
to the starting-point of the <i>Iliad</i>'] / primaque iuratis induis arma
uiris, / nos, Macer, ignaua Veneris cessamus in umbra' and <i>EP</i> II x<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
13-14 'tu canis aeterno quicquid restabat Homero, / ne careant summa
Troica bella manu'; Macer had written poems narrating those parts of the
Trojan war not covered by the <i>Iliad</i>.</p>

<p>The Macer mentioned at Tr IV x 43-44 must be a different person, for he
is described as already being <i>grandior aeuo</i> in Ovid's youth.</p>

<p><b>6. SIDEREVSQVE PEDO.</b> On Albinovanus Pedo, see at x 4 <i>Albinouane</i>
(<a href="#Page_327">p 327</a>).</p>

<p>For <i>sidereus</i> ('divine' or 'resplendent'), Bardon aptly cited Columella
X 434 (written in hexameters) '<i>siderei</i> uatis ... praecepta Maronis'.</p>

<p><b>7. ET, QVI IVNONEM LAESISSET IN HERCVLE, CARVS.</b> This is the Carus to
whom xiii is addressed: compare xiii 11-12 'prodent auctorem uires, quas
Hercule dignas / nouimus atque illi quem canis ipse pares'.</p>

<p>As Jupiter's son by Alcmene, Hercules suffered from Juno's enmity until
his deification.</p>

<p><b>8. IVNONIS SI IAM NON GENER ILLE FORET.</b> Perhaps Carus' poem included
Hercules' marriage to Hebe.</p>

to that poem; for <i>quique dedit Latio carmen regale</i>, see at ii 1 <i>uates
magnorum maxime regum</i> (<a href="#Page_162">p 162</a>).</p>

<p><b>10. SVBTILI ... NVMA.</b> Numa is otherwise unknown. <i>Subtilis</i> means 'clean
and elegant in style'; compare Cic <i>De or</i> I 180 'oratione maxime<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
limatus atque <i>subtilis</i>' and <i>Brutus</i> 35 'tum fuit Lysias ... egregie
<i>subtilis</i> scriptor atque elegans, quem iam prope audeas oratorem
perfectum dicere'.</p>

<p><b>10. PRISCVS VTERQVE.</b> Only one poet of this name is known, Clutorius (Tac
<i>Ann</i> III 49-51) or C. Lutorius (Dio LVII 20 3) Priscus. All that is
known of him is the manner of his death: in AD 21 he was put to death
for composing and reciting a premature poem on the death of Drusus.</p>

<p><b>11. IMPARIBVS NVMERIS ... VEL AEQVIS.</b> Like Ovid, Montanus wrote both
elegiac and hexameter verse.</p>

<p>For <i>impar</i> used of elegiac verse, compare Hor <i>AP</i> 75 (the earliest
instance) 'uersibus <i>impariter</i> iunctis', <i>Am</i> II xvii 21, <i>Am</i> III i
37, <i>AA</i> I 264, <i>Tr</i> II 220, <i>EP</i> II v 1 (<i>disparibus</i>), <i>EP</i> III iv 86
(<i>disparibus</i>), <i>EP</i> IV v 3 (<i>nec ... aequis</i>), and line 36 of the
present poem.</p>

<p><b>11. MONTANE.</b> Iulius Montanus is mentioned in passing at Sen <i>Cont</i> VII 1
27, where he is called <i>egregius poeta</i>; in Donatus' life of Virgil (29)
his admiration of Virgil's manner of reciting is mentioned, on the
authority of the elder Seneca. The younger Seneca, calling him
'tolerabilis poeta et amicitia Tiberi notus et frigore', tells some
amusing anecdotes about the length of his recitations and his fondness
for describing sunrises and sunsets (<i>Ep</i> CXXII 11-13). He quotes from
him twice (Morel 120).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>

<p><b>13-14. ET QVI PENELOPAE RESCRIBERE IVSSIT VLIXEM / ERRANTEM SAEVO PER
DVO LUSTRA MARI.</b> All that is known of Sabinus is what Ovid says here and
in his list of Sabinus' poems at <i>Am</i> II xviii 27-34 'quam cito de toto
rediit meus orbe Sabinus / scriptaque diuersis rettulit ille locis! /
candida Penelope signum cognouit Vlixis; / legit ab Hippolyto scripta
nouerca suo. / iam pius Aeneas miserae rescripsit Elissae, / quodque
legat Phyllis, si modo uiuit, adest. / tristis ad Hypsipylen ab Iasone
littera uenit; / det uotam Phoebo Lesbis amata lyram' (this line, like
the letter of Sappho, has been considered suspect; see R. J. Tarrant,
"The Authenticity of the Letter of Sappho to Phaon (<i>Heroides XV</i>)",
<i>HSPh</i> 85 [1981] 133-53).</p>

<p>Since the letter of Ulysses is the first one mentioned in the list at
<i>Am</i> II xviii 29, it was presumably the first poem in Sabinus'
collection of epistles; hence Ovid's use of it here to indicate the
entire collection.</p>

<p>Line 14 may be an echo of one of Sabinus' poems.</p>

<p><b>15. TRISOMEN</b> <i>C</i> TRISOMEM <i>B<sup>1</sup></i>. For the many other variants, see the
apparatus. The word is clearly corrupt; correction is difficult in the
absence of further information on Sabinus. TROEZENA (a conjecture
reported by Micyllus) seems unattractive. Heinsius had difficulty with
the passage: 'an <i>Tymelen</i>? opinor certe nomen puellae a Sabino
decantatae hic latere'. TROESMIN, suggested by Ehwald (<i>JAW</i> CIX [1901]
187), is unlikely&mdash;why would Sabinus have wished to recount Vestalis'
capture of the city?&mdash;but not, as claimed by Vollmer (PW I A,2<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span> 1598
34), unmetrical: lengthening is common enough before the main caesura
(although I have found no example of lengthened <i>-in</i>). Bardon (61)
wished to read TROEZEN (which is in fact the reading of <i>T</i>), apparently
not realizing that an accusative form is required.</p>

<p><b>15-16. DIERVM ... OPVS.</b> Sabinus apparently started work on a
calendar-poem, which may have resembled the <i>Fasti</i>; compare <i>Fast</i> I
101 'uates operose <i>dierum</i>'.</p>

<p><b>16. CELERI</b> = 'premature'.</p>

<p><b>17. INGENIIQVE SVI DICTVS COGNOMINE LARGVS.</b> For the play on the name
compare xiii 2 'qui quod es, id uere, Care, uocaris, aue'. Nothing is
known of Largus beyond what Ovid here tells us.</p>

<p><b>18. GALLICA QVI PHRYGIVM DVXIT IN ARVA SENEM.</b> Largus described Antenor's
migration to Venetia and founding of Patavium, for which see <i>Aen</i> I
242-49 and Livy I 1.</p>

<p><b>18. GALLICA ... ARVA.</b> Patavium was in Cisalpine Gaul.</p>

<p><b>18. PHRYGIVM ... SENEM.</b> At <i>Il</i> III 149-50 Antenor is listed among the
'&#948;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#947;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; ... &#947;&#942;&#961;&#945;&#953;&#776; &#948;&#8052; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#941;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#959; &#960;&#949;&#960;&#945;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;' sitting on the
Trojan wall who see Helen approach.</p>

<p><b>19. DOMITO ... AB HECTORE TROIAM.</b> 'The story of Troy after the death of
Hector'. <i>Gothanus II 121</i> has the interpolation DOMITAM ... AB HECTORE,
which Korn printed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span></p>

<p><b>19. CAMERINVS.</b> Nothing is known of this poet.</p>

<p><b>20. SVA PHYLLIDE.</b> Presumably Tuscus' equivalent of Gallus' Lycoris.
However, as Professor A. Dalzell points out, the reference to love
poetry is odd in a sequence of epic and didactic writers.</p>

<p><b>20. TVSCVS</b> is not otherwise certainly known. Kiessling (<i>Coniectanea
Propertiana</i>, Greifswald, 1875) proposed that he was the "Demophoon"
addressed in Prop II xxii; this suggestion has won support from Birt
[<i>RhM</i> XXXII [1877] 414), Bardon (61; I owe these references to him),
and Andr&eacute;, but does not seem extremely convincing, especially since
Propertius had been writing some three decades earlier. Merkel, in his
edition of the <i>Tristia</i> (p. 373), identifies him with the grammarian
Clodius Tuscus, without offering a reason.</p>

<p><b>21. VELIVOLIQVE MARIS VATES.</b> It is not known who this was, or what the
precise subject of the poem might have been; perhaps it resembled the
<i>Halieutica</i>. Andr&eacute; mentions that Varro Atacinus has been proposed, but
does not name the author of the suggestion, which seems rather fanciful;
as he points out, Varro had died some fifty years previously. Luck in
his edition has proposed Abronius Silo, of whom two hexameters survive
(Sen <i>Suas</i> II 19 = Morel 120), but, as Andr&eacute; remarks, the fact that he,
like Ovid, was a follower of the rhetor Porcius Latro is hardly
sufficient evidence for the identification.</p>

<p>For <i>ueliuolique</i> see at v 42 <i>ueliuolas</i> (<a href="#Page_224">p 224</a>).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<p><b>22. CAERVLEOS ... DEOS</b> = 'the gods of the sea'. Compare <i>Met</i> II 8
'<i>caeruleos</i> habet unda deos'.</p>

<p><b>23. ACIES LIBYCAS ROMANAQVE PROELIA.</b> The poem may have concerned the
Jugurthine war, or Caesar's African campaign; compare <i>Fast</i> IV 379-80
'illa dies Libycis qua Caesar in oris / perfida magnanimi contudit arma
Iubae'.</p>

<p>For the juxtaposition of opposing proper adjectives (<i>Libycas Romana</i>),
see Tarrant on Sen <i>Ag</i> 613-13a <i>Dardana tecto / Dorici ... ignes</i>.</p>

<p><b>24. ET MARIVS SCRIPTI DEXTER IN OMNE GENVS.</b> For the phrasing compare
<i>Tr</i> II 381-82 '<i>omne genus scripti</i> grauitate tragoedia uincit: / haec
quoque materiam semper amoris habet' and <i>Tr</i> II 517-18 'an <i>genus hoc
scripti</i> faciunt sua pulpita ['stage'] tutum, / quodque licet, mimis
scaena licere dedit?'. <i>C</i>'s MARIVS SCRIPTOR and <i>B</i>'s SCRIPTOR MARIVS
were no doubt induced by the hyperbaton of <i>scripti ... genus</i>.</p>

<p>Marius is not otherwise known.</p>

<p><b>25. TRINACRIVSQVE ... AVCTOR.</b> In view of the following <i>auctor ... Lupus</i>,
<i>Trinacrius</i> should be taken as a proper name, and not as an adjective.
The adjectival form of the name is, however, suspicious, and may be a
corruption far removed from what Ovid wrote.</p>

<p><b>25. SVAE</b> seems strange, and is probably corrupt. Wheeler translated
'Trinacrius who wrote of the <i>Perseid</i> he knew so well', while Andr&eacute;
ignored <i>suae</i> altogether: 'l'auteur trinacrien de la "Pers&eacute;ide"'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></p>

<p><b>25-26. AVCTOR / TANTALIDAE REDVCIS TYNDARIDOSQVE LVPVS.</b> Lupus (otherwise
unknown) apparently wrote of the return of Menelaus and Helen to Sparta.</p>

<p><i>Tantalides</i> is used only here of Menelaus. Elsewhere in Latin verse it
is used of Agamemnon, Atreus, and Pelops: see <i>OLD Tantalides</i>. Ovid is
here using the diction of high poetry.</p>

<p><b>27. ET QVI MAEONIAM PHAEACIDA VERTIT.</b> Tuticanus; his translation of the
Phaeacian episode of the Odyssey is mentioned at xii 27-28. As that poem
explains, his name could not be used in elegiac verse: hence the
periphrasis in this passage.</p>

<p><b>27. ET VNE</b> <i>HLB<sup>2</sup></i> ET VN<span class="u">E</span> <i>M<sup>2c</sup></i> ET VNA <i>IT</i> ET VNI <i>B<sup>1</sup>C</i> IN ANGVEM <i>F</i>.
<i>Vne</i> was liable to corruption because of the hyperbaton with <i>Rufe</i> in
the next line, and because of the rarity of the vocative of <i>unus</i>. For
<i>unus</i> in the sense 'unique, outstanding', compare Catullus XXXVII 17
'tu praeter omnes <i>une</i> de capillatis' ('you outstanding member of the
long-haired set'&mdash;Quinn) and Prop II iii 29 'gloria Romanis <i>una</i> es tu
nata puellis'.</p>

<p><b>27-28. VNE / PINDARICAE FIDICEN TV QVOQVE, RVFE, LYRAE.</b> An imitation of
Hor <i>Carm</i> IV iii 21-23 'totum muneris hoc tui est / quod monstror
digito praetereuntium / <i>Romanae fidicen lyrae</i>'.</p>

<p><b>28. RVFE.</b> Otherwise unknown. Andr&eacute; correctly points out that he is
unlikely to be the Rufus addressed in <i>EP</i> II xi, 'dont Ovid n'aurait
pas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span> manqu&eacute; alors de vanter le talent po&eacute;tique'. Bardon (59) mentions
that A. Reifferscheid ("Coniect. noua", <i>Ind. lect. Bresl.</i>, 1880/81, p.
7) identified this Rufus with the Pindaric poet Titius of Hor <i>Ep</i> I iii
9-10, thereby creating 'le tr&egrave;s synth&eacute;tique Titius Rufus'. But there is
nothing very compelling about the identification.</p>

<p><b>29. MVSAVE TVRRANI.</b> The poet is not otherwise certainly known. Bardon
(48) reports the conjectures of Hirschfeld ("Annona", <i>Philologus</i>,
1870, p. 27) identifying him with C. Turranius, <i>praefectus annonae</i> at
the time of Augustus' death (Tac <i>Ann</i> I 7) and of Munzer (<i>Beitr. zur
Quellenkritik</i> 387-89), identifying him with the geographical writer
Turranius Gracilis mentioned by the elder Pliny (<i>NH</i> III 3, IX 11).</p>

<p><b>29. INNIXA COTVRNIS.</b> The <i>coturnus</i> was distinguished by its high sole;
hence <i>innixa</i> ('supported by'). Compare <i>Am</i> III i 31 (of Tragedy)
'pictis <i>innixa coturnis</i>' and Hor <i>AP</i> 279-80 'Aeschylus ... docuit
magnumque loqui <i>nitique coturno</i>'.</p>

<p><b>29. COTVRNIS.</b> As Brink at Hor <i>AP</i> 80 points out, <i>coturnus</i> (not
<i>cothurnus</i>) is the spelling favoured by the best manuscripts of Virgil
and Horace.</p>

<p><b>30. ET TVA CVM SOCCO MVSA, MELISSE, LEVIS.</b> <i>H</i> offers LEVI, also
conjectured by Heinsius, which may be right: the epithet with <i>socco</i>
would provide a pleasing balance with the preceding <i>tragicis</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span><i>... coturnis</i>. On the other hand, Professor R. J. Tarrant in support of
<i>leuis</i> cites <i>RA</i> 375-76 'grande sonant tragici, tragicos decet ira
coturnos: / usibus e mediis <i>soccus</i> habendus erit' and Hor <i>AP</i> 80
'<i>socci</i> ... grandesque coturni'; in both passages <i>soccus</i> has no
adjective.</p>

<p>Propertius uses <i>Musa leuis</i> of his verse (II xii 22); compare as well
<i>Tr</i> II 354 'Musa iocosa' (Ovid's amatory verse), <i>EP</i> I v 69 'infelix
Musa', Lucretius IV 589 &amp; <i>Ecl</i> I 2 'siluestrem ... Musam', and
Quintilian X i 55 'Musa ... rustica et pastoralis' (the poetry of
Theocritus).</p>

<p><i>Leuis</i> is used of comedy at <i>Fast</i> V 347-48 'scaena <i>leuis</i> decet hanc
[<i>sc</i> Floram]: non est, mihi credite, non est / illa coturnatas inter
habenda deas' and Hor <i>AP</i> 231 'effutire <i>leues</i> indigna Tragoedia
uersus'.</p>

<p><b>30. MELISSE.</b> Thanks principally to Suetonius <i>Gram</i> 21, we are
comparatively well informed about Melissus (Schanz-Hosius 176-77 [&sect;
277]; Bardon 49-52). Brought up a slave (his father had disowned him at
birth), he was given a good education by the man who accepted him, and
was given to Maecenas, who manumitted him. He wrote one hundred and
fifty books of <i>Ineptiae</i>. 'Fecit et nouum genus togatarum inscripsitque
trabeatas'; it is no doubt these plays that Ovid is here referring to.</p>

<p><b>31. VARIVS.</b> Possibly the famous author of the <i>Thyestes</i> and editor of
the <i>Aeneid</i> (Schanz-Hosius 162-64 [&sect; 267]; Bardon 28-34; fragments at
Morel 100-1 and Ribbeck 265). Riese objected to the identification<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span> on
chronological grounds (the <i>Thyestes</i> was produced in 29 BC), but the
date of his death is unknown, and he may have survived to the time of
Ovid's exile.</p>

<p><b>31. GRACCHVSQVE.</b> The manuscripts omit the aspirate, and Ehwald cites
<i>CIL</i> VI 1 1505 for a mention of <i>Ti. Sempronius Graccus</i>, but in his
discussion of the aspirate Quintilian makes it clear that <i>Graccus</i> was
an obsolete spelling (I v 20).</p>

<p>Gracchus (Bardon 48-49) is mentioned by Priscian, Nonius, and the author
of the <i>De dubiis nominibus</i>, who among them preserve four fragments and
three titles (Ribbeck 266). One of the titles is a <i>Thyestes</i>; Professor
R. J. Tarrant plausibly suggests that Ovid may here be alluding to the
plays by Varius and Gracchus on the theme with his words <i>cum ... darent
fera uerba tyrannis</i>, Atreus being the archetype of the tyrant in
tragedy.</p>

<p>Nipperdey proposed that Ovid's Gracchus was the Sempronius Gracchus
implicated in the disgrace of Julia (Vel Pat II 100 5); see Syme <i>HO</i>
196 and Furneaux on Tac <i>Ann</i> I 53 4. The identification is however far
from certain.</p>

<p><b>32. CALLIMACHI PROCVLVS MOLLE TENERET ITER.</b> Proculus is otherwise
unknown. Ehwald suggested (<i>JAW</i> 43 [1885] 141) that he was a dramatic
poet like Varius and Gracchus, citing a mention of the '&#963;&#945;&#964;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8048; &#948;&#961;&#940;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;,
&#964;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#8179;&#948;&#943;&#945;&#953;, &#954;&#969;&#956;&#8179;&#948;&#943;&#945;&#953;' of Callimachus in the <i>Souda</i>. But
Callimachus' <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>primary reputation was hardly that of a tragedian; and
<i>molle ... iter</i> must be a reference to <i>Aetia</i> 25-28: '&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#972;&#948;' &#7940;&#957;&#969;&#947;&#945;, &#964;&#8048; &#956;&#8052;  &#960;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;

&#959;&#7991;&#956;&#959;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#8048; &#960;&#955;&#945;&#964;&#973;&#957;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#954;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#973;&#952;&#959;&#965;&#962; / [<i>Pfeiffer: </i>&#7936;&#964;&#961;&#943;&#960;&#964;&#959;]&#965;&#962;, &#949;&#7984; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#951;&#957;  &#7952;&#955;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;'.</p>

<p>For <i>mollis</i> used specifically of elegy (the <i>Aetia</i> were in elegiac
verse), see <i>EP</i> III iv 85 and Prop I vii 19 (cited by Andr&eacute;); for the
word in an overtly Callimachean context, see Prop III i 19 '<i>mollia</i>,
Pegasides, date uestro serta poetae'.</p>

<p><i>Tenere</i> here has the sense 'keep to', as at <i>Met</i> II 79 'ut ... uiam
<i>teneas</i>' and Q Cic (?) <i>Pet</i> 55 'perge <i>tenere</i> istam uiam quam
institisti [<i>Gruterus</i>: instituisti <i>codd</i>]'; Professor R. J. Tarrant
rightly sees a suggestion of conscious artistic preference, and a faint
allusion to the places where Augustan poets renounce the attractions of
higher poetry.</p>

<p><b>33. TITYRON ANTIQVAS PASSERQVE REDIRET AD HERBAS</b> <i>B<sup>1</sup>C</i>. For the many
variants and emendations proposed, see the apparatus.</p>

<p>Housman has offered a defence of <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>'s version of this line
(937-39). He accepted Riese's printing of <i>Passer</i> as a proper name ('M.
Petronius Passer' is mentioned at Varro <i>RR</i> III 2 2), and took the
passage to mean 'He wrote bucolics, or, as Ovid puts it, he went back to
Tityrus and the pastures of old': the construction is 'cum Passer
rediret ad Tityron antiquasque herbas'. In writing the line, Ovid
resorted to three devices, 'each of them legitimate, but not perhaps
elsewhere assembled in a single verse'. The first is the delay of the
preposition <i>ad</i> after <i>Tityron</i>, which it governs; the second is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span> the
delay of <i>-que</i>, which properly belongs with <i>antiquas</i>; and the third
is the placing of the verb between its two objects. For each of these
devices Housman furnishes convincing parallels.</p>

<p>Housman's argument is ingenious and informative, but I do not believe
that he is right in defending the line: the accumulation of difficulties
is suspicious, and the divergence of the manuscripts is greater here
than at any other point in the book. Heinsius wrote of the line, 'haec
nec Latina sunt, nec satis intelligo quid sibi uelint'. Like Heinsius, I
believe the line to be deeply corrupted and, in the absence of further
evidence, impossible to correct.</p>

<p><b>34. APTAQVE VENANTI GRATTIVS ARMA DARET.</b> Compare Grattius 23 'carmine et
arma dabo et uenandi [<i>cod</i>: uenanti et <i>Vlitius</i>] persequar artis'.</p>

<p><b>34. GRATTIVS.</b> The manuscripts have GRATIVS (<i>CFLT</i>) or GRACIVS (<i>BMHI</i>);
and <i>Gratius</i> is what editors both of Ovid and Grattius printed until
Buecheler pointed out (<i>RhM</i> 35 [1880] 407) that <i>Grattius</i> is the only
form found in inscriptions, and is what is given in the oldest
manuscript of Grattius, <i>Vindobonensis 277</i> (saec viii/ix), which
predates the manuscripts of <i>EP</i> IV by at least four hundred years.</p>

<p><b>35. NAIADAS</b> <i>C. P. Jones</i> NAIADAS A <i>HLI<sup>2</sup></i> NAYADES A <i>MT</i> NAIDAS A
<i>BCFI<sup>2</sup></i>. Ovid elsewhere invariably uses the dative of agent with
<i>amatus</i> (<i>Am</i> I v 12, II viii 12, III ix 55-56, <i>AA</i> II 80, <i>Tr</i> I vi
2, II 400, III i 42, IV x 40).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span></p>

<p>As Professor Jones notes, following the interpolation of <i>a</i>, the
shorter form <i>Naidas</i> was introduced in <i>BCFI<sup>1</sup></i> to restore metre.</p>

<p><b>35-36. FONTANVS ... CAPELLA.</b> Neither poet is otherwise known.</p>

<p><b>36. IMPARIBVS ... MODIS.</b> See at 11 <i>imparibus numeris ... uel aequis</i>
(<a href="#Page_453">p 453</a>).</p>

<p><b>37-38. QVORVM MIHI CVNCTA REFERRE / NOMINA LONGA MORA EST.</b> Similar
phrasing at <i>Met</i> XIII 205-6 '<i>longa referre mora est</i> quae consilioque
manuque / utiliter feci spatiosi tempore belli' and <i>Fast</i> V 311-12
(Flora speaking) '<i>longa referre mora est</i> correcta obliuia damnis; / me
quoque Romani praeteriere patres'.</p>

<p><b>39-40. ESSENT ET IVVENES QVORVM, QVOD INEDITA CVRA EST, / APPELLANDORVM
NIL MIHI IVRIS ADEST.</b> All editors, misled no doubt by 37, mispunctuate
this passage, placing a comma before <i>quorum</i> instead of after: this
destroys the gerundive <i>quorum ... appellandorum</i>, leaving the pentameter
without a construction.</p>

<p>Williams proposed excising this distich, the reasons being (1) the
sudden change from <i>forent</i> to <i>essent</i>, (2) the use of <i>inedita</i>, which
is not found elsewhere, (3) the use of <i>cura</i> in a sense, 'written
work', that is found only in late Latin, and (4) the prose turn of
<i>quorum ... appellandorum</i>. To which it can be replied that (1) <i>forent</i>
and <i>essent</i> are equivalent, and metrical convenience alone could
justify the change, (2) the use of negatived perfect participles such as
<i>inedita</i>, <i>indeclinatus</i> (x 83), and <i>inoblita</i> (xv 37) is a hallmark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
of Ovid's style, (3) <i>cura</i> is used in this sense by Tacitus (<i>Dial</i> 3 3
&amp; 6 5; <i>Ann</i> III 24 4 &amp; IV 11 5); its earlier use in verse is not
surprising, and (4) gerundives were allowed in Latin verse; here, as at
ix 12 '<i>salutandi</i> munere functa <i>tui</i>', the hyperbaton compensates for
any awkwardness.</p>

<p><b>39. CVRA</b> <i>unus Thuaneus Heinsii</i> CAVSA <i>BCMFHILT</i>. The same error in
some manuscripts at <i>Her</i> I 20 'Tlepolemi leto <i>cura</i> nouata mea est',
and <i>Fast</i> I 55 'uindicat Ausonias Iunonis <i>cura</i> Kalendas'; the inverse
corruption at <i>Am</i> II xii 17 and <i>Fast</i> IV 368.</p>

<p>In 1894 Owen printed <i>causa</i>. The word can certainly have the meaning he
attributed to it ('&#8017;&#960;&#972;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;', 'theme'), as at Prop II i 12
'inuenio <i>causas</i> mille poeta nouas', but this does not seem appropriate
to the context here. In his later edition Owen returned to the usual
reading.</p>

<p><b>41. APPELLANDORVM.</b> <i>Appellare</i> used with the same sense (<i>OLD appello<sup>2</sup></i>
11) at III vi 6 '<i>appellent</i> ne te carmina nostra rogas';
<i>n&#333;m&#301;n&#257;re</i> was not available for Ovid's use.</p>

<p><b>41-44. COTTA ... MAXIME.</b> M. Aurelius Cotta Maximus Messalinus<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
(<i>Forschungen in Ephesos</i> III 112 no. 22; cited by Syme <i>HO</i> 117) was
the younger son of Messalla, the patron of Tibullus; he was the
recipient of six of the <i>Epistulae ex Ponto</i> (I v, I ix, II iii, II
viii,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span> III ii &amp; III v). He is undoubtedly the M. Aurelius or Aurelius
Cotta recorded by Tacitus as consul for 20 (<i>Ann</i> III 2 3 &amp; 17 4). He
was born much later than his brother Messalinus (the addressee of <i>EP</i> I
vii and II ii), who was consul in 3 BC; the chronology is confirmed by a
mention of him as praetor in 17 (<i>Inscriptiones Italiae</i> XIII i p. 298;
see Syme <i>Ten Studies</i> 52), and by Ovid's testimony that Cotta was born
after Ovid had become acquainted with his family (<i>EP</i> II iii 69-80).
Cotta was clearly a very close friend of Ovid; this can be seen
particularly from <i>EP</i> II iii, in which Ovid recounts how Cotta sent the
first letter of comfort after his catastrophe (67-68) and tells how he
confessed his <i>error</i> to Cotta.
]
Tacitus gives some information on Cotta's public career. In AD 16, in
the aftermath of the discovery of Libo's plot against Tiberius, Cotta
proposed that Libo's image not be in his descendants' funeral
processions (<i>Ann</i> II 32 1). In 20, as consul, he similarly proposed
penalties against Piso's family (<i>Ann</i> III 17), and in 27 he is
mentioned as attacking Agrippina so as to please Tiberius (<i>Ann</i> V 3).
The most interesting mention of him is at <i>Ann</i> VI 5 (AD 32), where
Tacitus tells of how Tiberius himself intervened in favour of Cotta
after he had been charged with <i>maiestas</i>; the eventual result was that
charges were laid against Cotta's chief accuser.</p>

<p><b>42. PIERIDVM LVMEN.</b> At <i>EP</i> III v 29-36 Ovid asked Cotta to send him
some of his poetry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span></p>

<p>For the sense of <i>lumen</i> here ('ornament'), <i>OLD lumen</i> 11 cites among
other passages Cic <i>Sul</i> 5 'haec ornamenta ac <i>lumina</i> rei publicae' and
<i>Phil II</i> 54 (of Pompey) 'imperi populi Romani decus ac <i>lumen</i> fuit'.</p>

<p><b>42. PRAESIDIVMQVE FORI</b> = 'defender of the law'. Compare vi 33-34 'cum
tibi suscepta est <i>legis uindicta seuerae</i>, / uerba uelut taetrum
singula uirus habent'.</p>

<p><b>43. MATERNOS COTTAS.</b> This passage should be taken in conjunction with
<i>EP</i> III ii 103-8 (to Cotta) 'adde quod est animus semper tibi mitis, et
altae / indicium mores nobilitatis habent, / quos Volesus patrii
cognoscat nominis auctor, / quos Numa maternus non neget esse suos, /
adiectique probent genetiua ad nomina Cottae, / si tu non esses,
interitura domus'. The simplest explanation of these two passages is
that Cotta had been adopted by a maternal uncle, the last surviving
Aurelius Cotta.</p>

<p>The question of Cotta's maternal ancestry is a vexed one; for a full
discussion see Syme <i>HO</i> 119-21.</p>

<p>The present passage was written with Prop IV xi 31-32 in mind: 'altera
<i>maternos</i> exaequat turba <i>Libones</i>, / et domus est titulis utraque
fulta suis'.</p>

<p><b>44. NOBILITAS INGEMINATA.</b> In a famous study (<i>Kleine Schriften</i> I 1 ff.;
trans. <i>The Roman Nobility</i> [1969]), Matthias Gelzer demonstrated that
the usual meaning of <i>nobilis</i> was 'descended from a consul'. Cotta was
descended from a consul on both sides.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span></p>

<p>At <i>Met</i> XIII 144-47 Ovid uses <i>nobilitas</i> to mean 'descent from a god':
(Ulysses speaking) 'mihi Laertes pater est, Arcesius illi, / Iuppiter
huic ... est quoque <i>per matrem</i> Cyllenius <i>addita</i> nobis / <i>altera
nobilitas</i>: deus est in utroque parente!'.</p>

<p><b>44. INGEMINATA.</b> A verbal echo of <i>EP</i> I ii 1-2 (to Fabius Maximus)
'Maxime, qui tanti mensuram nominis imples, / et <i>geminas</i> animi
<i>nobilitate</i> genus'.</p>

<p><b>46. ATQVE INTER TANTOS QVAE LEGERETVR ERAT.</b> This is the end of the
sentence that began at 5.</p>

<p><b>46. INTER TANTOS.</b> Compare <i>EP</i> III i 55-56 (Ovid has just compared
himself to Capaneus, Amphiaraus, Ulysses, and Philoctetes) 'si locus est
aliquis <i>tanta inter nomina</i> paruis, / nos quoque conspicuos nostra
ruina facit'.</p>

<p><b>47. SVMMOTVM</b> <i>codd</i> SVBMOTVM <i>edd</i>. The assimilated <i>summ-</i> is standard
in the manuscripts of Virgil and Lucretius, and should not be altered.</p>

<p><b>47. PROSCINDERE</b> = 'revile, defame'. This seems to be the first instance
of the word in this sense; the other examples cited by <i>OLD</i> <i>proscindo</i>
3 are Val Max V iii 3, Val Max VIII 5 2 'C. Flauium eadem lege accusatum
testis <i>proscidit</i>', Pliny <i>NH</i> XXXIII 6, and Suet <i>Cal</i> 30 2 'equestrem
ordinem ut scaenae harenaeque deuotum assidue <i>proscidit</i>'. The word
connects with <i>laceras</i> in the first line of the poem, and with <i>neu
cineres sparge, cruente, meos</i> in 48.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span></p>

<p><b>49. OMNIA PERDIDIMVS.</b> The same phrase at <i>Met</i> XIII 527-28 (Hecuba
speaking) '<i>omnia perdidimus</i>: superest cur uiuere tempus / in breue
sustineam proles gratissima matri'.</p>

<p><b>49. TANTVMMODO</b> is a prose word. It occurs elsewhere in Ovid only at
<i>Fast</i> III 361 'ortus erat summo <i>tantummodo</i> margine Phoebus' and at
<i>Tr</i> III vii 29-30 'pone, Perilla, metum; <i>tantummodo</i> femina nulla /
neue uir a scriptis discat amare tuis'. Being a colloquial term, it is
found in satire (Hor <i>Sat</i> I ix 54) and comedy (Ter <i>Ph</i> 109).</p>

<p><b>50. SENSVM MATERIAMQVE MALI.</b> 'An occasion for pain, and the ability to
feel it'. For <i>sensum</i> compare <i>EP</i> I ii 29-30 'felicem Nioben ... quae
posuit <i>sensum</i> saxea facta <i>mali</i> [<i>uar</i> malis]' and <i>EP</i> I ii 37
'uiuimus ut numquam <i>sensu</i> careamus amaro'. For <i>materiam</i> compare
<i>Her</i> VII 34 'materiam curae praebeat ille meae!', <i>Met</i> X 133-34 'ut
leuiter pro materiaque doleret / admonuit' and <i>EP</i> I x 23-24 'dolores,
/ quorum materiam dat locus ipse mihi'.</p>

<p><b>51-52. QVID IVVAT EXTINCTOS FERRVM DEMITTERE IN ARTVS? / NON HABET IN
NOBIS IAM NOVA PLAGA LOCVM.</b> I believe this distich is an interpolation
for the following reasons:</p>

<p>(1) Lines 49-50 form an effective ending, which 51-52 weaken. In 49-50
Ovid says that life is all that is left to him; and in 52 it is stated
that he is already wounded in every place possible. These statements are
contradictory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) The use of a weapon in 51 is at odds with the rending metaphor of
<i>laceras</i> (1) and <i>proscindere</i> (47).</p>

<p>(3) There seems something peculiar about <i>ferrum demittere in artus</i>;
the examples of <i>demittere</i> with this sense in the <i>Metamorphoses</i>
involve <i>ilia</i> (IV 119, XII 441), <i>armi</i> (XII 491), and <i>iugulum</i> (XIII
436; similar phrasing at <i>Her</i> XIV 5).</p>

<p>The distich's fabrication was assisted by <i>EP</i> II vii 41-42 'sic ego
continue Fortunae uulneror ictu, / <i>uixque habet in nobis iam noua plaga
locum</i>'.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The evidence for Ovid's <i>error</i> and the many theories
advanced to explain it are gathered and fully discussed in J. C.
Thibault's <i>The Mystery of Ovid's Exile</i> (Berkeley: 1964).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> For these references I am indebted to page xxxv of A. L.
Wheeler's excellent introduction to the Loeb edition of the <i>Tristia</i>
and <i>Ex Ponto</i>. For the date of Tiberius' triumph, see Syme <i>History in
Ovid</i> 40.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Professor Tarrant notes however that unlike I-III the
fourth book was not written within a very short time; if Ovid had
collected what he thought worth publishing of his output over several
years, it would not be surprising to find it longer than the preceding
collections.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Professor E. Fantham notes as well the central placement of
poem ix, with its <i>laudes Augusti</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Full information on what is known of each of the addressees
will be found in the introductions to the poems in the commentary.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Ovid had used a similar technique in <i>Tr</i> I i, where he
gives his book instructions for its voyage to Rome, including directions
on how it should approach Augustus.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Professor R. J. Tarrant points out to me in particular that
lines 63-64 on the apotheosis of Augustus being in part accomplished
through poetry are one of the few instances in the poetry of exile of
Ovid's earlier mischievous irony towards Augustus&mdash;a sign of a return on
Ovid's part to his earlier form.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> However, Albinovanus' poem on Germanicus' campaigns may
have had a strong geographical element; as Professor E. Fantham notes,
Ovid may here be appealing to this interest, or demonstrating
competitive skill in handling the topic.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The manuscripts were probably produced at the same German
centre. Professor R. J. Tarrant has noted the presence of the <i>Ex Ponto</i>
in book-lists of the eleventh and early twelfth centuries from
Blaubeuern, Tegernsee, Bamberg, Egmond, and Cracow (<i>Texts and
Transmission</i> 263); he suggests Tegernsee to me as a probable candidate
for the production of <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> G. P. Goold ("Amatoria Critica", <i>HSPh</i> 69 [1965] 10) has
an interesting discussion of the problems in establishing Ovid's
orthography. For accusative plural endings in the third declension, he
concludes that <i>-is</i> for Ovid can be neither established nor excluded.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> In recent years much progress has been made in identifying
the manuscripts Heinsius used. See the monograph of Munari and the
articles of Reeve and Lenz listed in the bibliography.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> <i>Electa minora ex Ovidio, Tibullo et Propertio</i>, London,
1705. The book was reprinted as late as 1860 (<i>Brit. Mus. Gen.
Catalogue</i>, vol. 177, col. 470). I quote some of the notes on x in the
commentary and apparatus.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> 'Diligenter autem et religiose tractaui codicem et

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> A. Grafton has noted that Heinsius' publisher Elzevier
seems to have been unwilling to alter the text as it already existed
(<i>JRS</i> LXVII [1977], 173). I owe my knowledge of Heinsius' editorial
practices as here described to Professor R. J. Tarrant, who has examined
the Harvard copies of the 1664 edition of Heinsius' text (without
notes), the 1670 Leiden edition of Bernard Cnippingius, which reproduces
Heinsius' notes, and the 1663 reprint of Daniel Heinsius' edition.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Consequently any statements I make on Heinsius' editorial
practices are based on explicit statements in his notes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> Macrobius does include the explanation for the
freezing-over. In view of his fuller account, I believe that Macrobius
drew his material from Gellius' source and not from Gellius. It is of
course possible enough that Macrobius conflated Gellius with another
source.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> This seems the best solution to the awkwardness of the
line as currently printed. Gellius IX xiv 21 gives two examples of
dative <i>facie</i> from Lucilius. Plautus regularly uses <i>fide</i> (<i>Aul</i> 667,
<i>Pers</i> 193, <i>Poen</i> 890, <i>Trin</i> 117) and <i>die</i> (<i>Am</i> 546, <i>Capt</i> 464,
<i>Trin</i> 843); dative <i>pube</i> is found at <i>Pseud</i> 126. Sallust and Caesar
use <i>fide</i> (<i>Iug</i> 16 3; <i>BG</i> V 3 7); at the time of Germanicus, <i>fide</i>
is found at Hor <i>Sat</i> I iii 94-95 'quid faciam si furtum fecerit, aut si
